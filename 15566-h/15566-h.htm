<h2>Introduction on Tragedies</h2>
<p>Dr. Johnson's reaction to Shakespeare's tragedies is a curious
one, compounded as it is of deep emotional involvement in a few
scenes in some plays and a strange dispassionateness toward most of
the others. I suspect that his emotional involvement took root when
he read Shakespeare as a boy&mdash;one remembers the terror he
experienced in reading of the Ghost in <i>Hamlet</i>, and it was
probably also as a boy that he suffered that shock of horrified
outrage and grief at the death of Cordelia that prevented him from
rereading the scene until be came to edit the play. Johnson's
deepest feelings and convictions, Professor Clifford has recently
reminded us, can be traced back to his childhood and adolescence.
But it is surprising to learn, as one does from his commentary,
that other scenes in these very plays (<i>Hamlet</i> and <i>King
Lear</i>, and in <i>Macbeth</i>, too) leave him unmoved, if one can
so interpret the absence of any but an explanatory note on, say,
Lear's speech beginning "Pray, do not mock me;/I am a very foolish
fond old man." Besides this negative evidence there is also the
positive evidence of many notes which display the dispassionate
editorial mind at work where one might expect from Johnson an
outburst of personal feeling. There are enough of these outbursts
to warrant our expecting others, but we are too frequently
disappointed. Perhaps Johnson thought of most of Shakespeare's
tragedies as "imperial tragedies" and that is why he could maintain
a stance of aloofness; conversely, "the play of <i>Timon</i> is a
domestick Tragedy, and therefore strongly fastens on the attention
of the reader." But the "tragedy" of Timon does not capture the
attention of the modern reader, and perhaps all attempts to fix
Johnson's likes and dislikes, and the reasons for them, in the
canon of Shakespeare's plays must circle endlessly without ever
getting to their destination.</p>
<h2>TRAGEDIES</h2>
<h3>Vol. IV</h3>
<h2>MACBETH</h2>
<p>(392) Most of the notes which the present editor has subjoined
to this play were published by him in a small pamphlet in 1745.</p>
<p>I.i (393,*) <i>Enter three Witches</i>] In order to make a true
estimate of the abilities and merit of a writer, it it always
necessary to examine the genius of his age, and the opinions of his
contemporaries. A poet who should now make the whole action of his
tragedy depend upon enchantment, and produce the chief events by
the assistance of supernatural agents, would be censured as
transgressing the bounds of probability, be banished from the
theatre to the nursery, and condemned to write fairy tales instead
of tragedies; but a survey of the notions that prevailed at the
time when this play was written, will prove that Shakespeare was in
no danger of such censures, since he only turned the system that
was then universally admitted, to his advantage, and was far from
overburthening the credulity of his audience.</p>
<p>The reality of witchcraft or enchantment, which, though not
strictly the same, are confounded in this play, has in all ages and
countries been credited by the common people, and in most, by the
learned themselves. These phantoms have indeed appeared more
frequently, in proportion as the darkness of ignorance has been
more gross; but it cannot be shown, that the brightest gleams of
knowledge have at any time been sufficient to drive them out of the
world. The time in which this kind of credulity was at its height,
seems to have been that of the holy war, in which the Christians
imputed all their defeats to enchantments or diabolical opposition,
as they ascribed their success to the assistance of their military
saints; and the learned Dr. Warburton appears to believe (<i>Suppl.
to the Introduction to Don Quixote</i>) that the first accounts of
enchantments were brought into this part of the world by those
<i>who</i> returned from their eastern expeditions. But there is
always some distance between the birth and maturity of folly as of
wickedness: this opinion had long existed, though perhaps the
application of it had in no foregoing age been so frequent, nor the
reception so general. Olympiodorus, in Photius's extracts, tells us
of one Libanius, who practised this kind of military magic, and
having promised [Greek: choris opliton kata barbaron energein] to
perform great things against the Barbarians without soldiers, was,
at the instances of the empress Placidia, put to death, when he was
about to have given proofs of his abilities. The empress shewed
some kindness in her anger by cutting him off at a time so
convenient for his reputation.</p>
<p>But a more remarkable proof of the antiquity of this notion may
be found in St. Chrysostom's book <i>de Sacerdotia</i>, which
exhibits a scene of enchantments not exceeded by any romance of the
middle age: he supposes a spectator overlooking a field of battle
attended by one that points out all the various objects of horror,
the engines of destruction, and the arts of slaughter. [Greek:
Deichnuto de eti para tois enantiois kai petomenous hippous dia
tinos magganeias, kai oplitas di' aeros pheromenous, kai pasaen
goaeteias dunomin kai idean.] <i>Let him then proceed to shew him
in the opposite armies horses flying by enchantment, armed men
transported through the air, and every power and form of magic.</i>
Whether St. Chrysostom believed that such performances were really
to be seen in a day of battle, or only endeavoured to enliven his
description, by adopting the notions of the vulgar, it is equally
certain, that such nations were in his time received, and that
therefore they were not imported from the Saracens in a later age;
the wars with the Saracens however gave occasion to their
propagation, not only as bigotry naturally discovers prodigies, but
as the scene of action was removed to a great distance.</p>
<p>The Reformation did not immediately arrive at its meridian, and
though day was gradually encreasing upon us, the goblins of
witchcraft still continued to hover in the twilight. In the time of
queen Elizabeth was the remarkable trial of the witches of Warbois,
whose conviction is still commemorated in an annual sermon at
Huntingdon. But in the reign of king James, in which this tragedy
was written, many circumstances concurred to propagate and confirm
this opinion. The king, who was much celebrated for his knowledge,
had, before his arrival in England, not only examined in person a
woman accused of witchcraft, but had given a very formal account of
the practices and illusions of evil spirits, the compacts of
witches, the ceremonies used by them, the manner of detecting them,
and the justice of punishing them, in his dialogues of
<i>Daemonologie</i>, written in the Scottish dialect, and published
at Edinburgh. This book was, soon after his accession, reprinted at
London, and as the ready way to gain king James's favour was to
flatter his speculations, the system of <i>Daemonologie</i> was
immediately adopted by all who desired either to gain preferment or
not to lose it. Thus the doctrine of witchcraft was very powerfully
inculcated; and as the greatest part of mankind have no other
reason for their opinions than that they are in fashion, it cannot
be doubted but this persuasion made a rapid progress, since vanity
and credulity co-operated in its favour. The infection soon reached
the parliament, who, in the first year of king James, made a law,
by which it was enacted, chap. xii. "That if any person shall use
any invocation or conjuration of any evil or wicked spirit; 2. or
shall consult, covenant with, entertain, employ, feed or reward any
evil or cursed spirit to or for any intent or purpose; 3. or take
up any dead man, woman or child out of the grave,&mdash;or the
skin, bone, or any part of the dead person, to be employed or used
in any manner of witchcraft, sorcery, charm, or enchantment; 4. or
shall use, practise or exercise any sort of witchcraft, sorcery,
charm, or enchantment; 5. whereby any person shall be destroyed,
killed, wasted, consumed, pined, or lamed in any part of the body;
6. That every such person being convicted shall suffer death." This
law was repealed in our own time.</p>
<p>Thus, in the time of Shakespeare, was the doctrine of witchcraft
at once established by law and by the fashion, and it became not
only unpolite, but criminal, to doubt it; and as prodigies are
always seen in proportion as they are expected, witches were every
day discovered, and multiplied as fast in some places, that bishop
Hall mentions a village in Lancashire, where their number was
greater than that of the houses. The jesuits and sectaries took
advantage of this universal error, and endeavoured to promote the
interest of their parties by pretended cures of persons afflicted
by evil spirits; but they were detected and exposed by the clergy
of the established church.</p>
<p>Upon this general infatuation Shakespeare might be easily
allowed to found a play, especially since he has followed with
great exactness such histories as were then thought true; nor can
it be doubted that the scenes of enchantment, however they may now
be ridiculed, were both by himself and his audience thought awful
and affecting.</p>
<p>I.i.10 (396,5) Fair is foul, and foul is fair] I believe the
meaning is, that <i>to us</i>, perverse and malignant as we are,
<i>fair is foul, and foul is fair</i>.</p>
<p>I.ii.14 (398,9) And Fortune, on his damned quarry smiling] Thus
the old copy; but I am inclined to read <i>quarrel</i>.
<i>Quarrel</i> was formerly used for <i>cause</i>, or for <i>the
occasion of a quarrel</i>, and is to be found in that sense in
Hollingshed's account of the story of Macbeth, who, upon the
creation of the prince of Cumberland, thought, says the historian,
that he had <i>a just quarrel</i>, to endeavour after the crown.
The sense therefore is, <i>Fortune smiling on his excrable
cause</i>, &amp;c. This is followed by Dr. Warburten. (see 1765,
VI, 373, 4).</p>
<p>I.ii.28 (400,4) Discomfort swells] <i>Discomfort</i> the natural
opposite to <i>comfort</i>. <i>Well'd</i>, for <i>flawed</i>, was
an emendation. The common copies have, <i>discomfort
swells</i>.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>I.ii.37 (400,5) As cannons overcharg'd with double cracks,</p>
<p>So they</p>
<p>Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Mr. Theobald has endeavoured to improve the sense of this
passage by altering the punctuation thus:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>they were</i></p>
<p><i>As cannons overcharg'd, with double cracks</i></p>
<p><i>So they redoubled strokes</i>&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>He declares, with some degree of exultation, that he has no idea
of a <i>cannon charged with double cracks</i>; but surely the great
author will not gain much by an alteration which makes him say of a
hero, that he <i>redoubles strokes with double cracks</i>, an
expression not more loudly to be applauded, or more easily pardoned
than that which is rejected in its favour. That a cannon is charged
<i>with thunder</i>, or <i>with double thunders</i>, may be
written, not only without nonsense, but with elegance, and nothing
else is here meant by <i>cracks</i>, which in the time of this
writer was a word of such emphasis and dignity, that in this play
he terms the general dissolution of nature the <i>crack of
doom</i>.</p>
<p>The old copy reads,</p>
<p><i>They doubly redoubled strokes</i>.</p>
<p>I.ii.46 (401,8) So should he look, that seems to speak things
strange] The meaning of this passage, as it now stands, is, <i>so
should he look, that looks as if he told things strange</i>. But
Rosse neither yet told strange things, nor could look as if he told
them; Lenox only conjectured from his air that he had strange
things to tell, and therefore undoubtedly said,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>What haste looks thro' his eyes?</i></p>
<p><i>So should he look, that</i> teems <i>to speak thinks
strange</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>He looks like one that <i>is big with</i> something of
importance; a metaphor so natural that it is every day used in
common discourse.</p>
<p>I.ii.55 (402,1) Confronted him with self-comparisons] [Theobald
interpreted "him" as Cawdor; Johnson, in 1745, accused Shakespeare
of forgetfulness on the basis of Theobald's error; and Warburton
here speaks of "blunder upon blunder."] The second blunderer was
the present editor.</p>
<p>I.iii.6 (403,5) <i>Aroint thee, witch</i>!] In one of the folio
editions the reading is <i>Anoint thee</i>, in a sense very
consistent with the common accounts of witches, who are related to
perform many supernatural acts by the means of unguents, and
particularly to fly through the air to the places where they meet
at their hellish festivals. In this sense, <i>anoint thee,
Witch</i>, will mean, <i>Away, Witch, to your infernal
assembly</i>. This reading I was inclined to favour, because I had
met with the word <i>aroint</i> in no other authour till looking
into Hearne's Collections I found it in a very old drawing, that he
has published, in which St. Patrick is represented visiting hell,
and putting the devils into great confusion by his presence, of
whom one that is driving the damned before him with a prong, has a
label issuing out of his mouth with these words, OUT OUT ARONGT, of
which the last is evidently the same with <i>aroint</i>, and used
in the same sense as in this passage.</p>
<p>I.iii.15 (405,8) And the very points they blew] As the word
<i>very</i> is here of no other use than to fill up the verse, it
is likely that Shakespeare wrote <i>various</i>, which might be
easily mistaken for <i>very</i>, being either negligently read,
hastily pronounced, or imperfectly heard.</p>
<p>I.iii.21 (405,9) He shall live a man forbid] Mr. Theobald has
very justly explained <i>forbid</i> by <i>accursed</i>, but without
giving any reason of his interpretation.</p>
<p>As to <i>forbid</i> therefore implies to <i>prohibit</i>, in
opposition to the word <i>bid</i> in its present sense, it
signifies by the same kind of opposition to <i>curse</i>, when it
is derived from the same word in its primitive meaning.</p>
<p>I.iii.42 (409,3) are you aught/That man may question?] Are ye
any beings with which man is permitted to hold converse, or of
which it is lawful <i>to ask questions</i>?</p>
<p>I.iii.53 (410,5) Are ye fantastical] By <i>fantastical</i>, he
means creatures of fantasy or imagination; the question is, Are
these real beings before us, or are we deceived by illusions of
fancy?</p>
<p>I.iii.97 (412,8) As thick as tale] [As thick as hail] Was Mr.
Pope's correction. The old copy has,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>As thick</i> as tale</p>
<p><i>Can</i> post <i>with</i> post;&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>which perhaps is not amiss, meaning that the news came as
<i>thick</i> as a <i>tale</i> can <i>travel</i> with the
<i>post</i>. Or we may read, perhaps yet better,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>As thick as tale</i></p>
<p>Came <i>post with post</i>;&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>That is, posts arrived as fast as they could be counted.</p>
<p>I.iii.130 (414,4) This supernatural solliciting]
<i>Solliciting</i> is rather, in my opinion, <i>incitement</i> than
<i>information</i>.</p>
<p>I.iii.134 (414,5) why do I yield] To <i>yield</i> is, simply, to
<i>give way to</i>.</p>
<p>I.iii.137 (414,6) Present fears/Are less than horrible
imaginings] [W: feats] <i>Present fears</i> are <i>fears of things
present</i>, which Macbeth declares, and every man has found, to be
less than the <i>imagination</i> presents them while the objects
are yet distant. <i>Fears</i> is right.</p>
<p>I.iii.140 (415,7) single state of man] The <i>single state of
man</i> seems to be used by Shakespeare for an <i>individual</i>,
in opposition to a <i>commonwealth</i>, or <i>conjunct
body</i>.</p>
<p>I.iii.40 (415,8) function/Is smother'd in surmise; and nothing
is,/ But what is not] All powers of action are oppressed and
crushed by one overwhelming image in the mind, and nothing is
present to me, but that which is really future. Of things now about
me I have no perception, being intent wholly on that which has yet
no existence.</p>
<p>I.iii.147 (415,9) Time and the hour runs through the roughest
day] I suppose every reader is disgusted at the tautology in this
passage, <i>Time and the hour</i>, and will therefore willingly
believe that Shakespeare wrote it thus,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Come what come may</i>,</p>
<p>Time! on!&mdash;<i>the hour runs thro' the roughest day</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Macbeth is deliberating upon the events which are to befall him,
but finding no satisfaction from his own thoughts, he grows
impatient of reflection, and resolves to wait the close without
harrassing hinaelf with conjectures.</p>
<p><i>Come what come may</i>.</p>
<p>But to shorten the pain of suspense, he calls upon Time In the
usual stile of ardent desire, to quicken his motion,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Time! on!</i> &mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>He then comforts himself with the reflection that all his
perplexity must have an end,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>the hour runs thro' the roughest day.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This conjecture is supported by the passage in the letter to his
lady, in which he says, <i>they referred me to the</i> coming on of
time, <i>with Hail, King that shalt be</i>.</p>
<p>I.iii.149 (416,1) My dull brain was wrought] My head was
<i>worked</i>, <i>agitated</i>, put into commotion.</p>
<p>I.iv.9 (417,3) studied in his death] Instructed in the art of
dying. It was usual to say <i>studied</i>, for <i>learned</i> in
science.</p>
<p>I.iv.12 (417,4) To find the mind's construction in the face] The
<i>construction of the mind</i> is, I believe, a phrase peculiar to
Shakespeare; it implies the <i>frame</i> or <i>disposition</i> of
the mind, by which it is determined to good or ill.</p>
<p>I.iv.26 (418,5) Which do but what they should, by doing
everything, Safe toward your love and honour] Of the last line of
this speech, which is certainly, as it is now read, unintelligible,
an emendation has been attempted, which Dr. Warburton and Dr.
Theobald once admitted as the true reading:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>our duties</i></p>
<p><i>Are to your throne and state, children and servants,</i></p>
<p><i>Which do but what they should, in doing every thing</i></p>
<p>Fiefs <i>to your love and honour.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>My esteem for these critics inclines me to believe that they
cannot be much pleased with these expressions <i>fiefs to love</i>,
or <i>fiefs to honour</i>, and that they have proposed this
alteration rather because no other occured to them, than because
they approved of it. I shall therefore propose a bolder change,
perhaps with no better success, but <i>sua cuique placent</i>. I
read thus,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>our duties</i></p>
<p><i>Are to your throne and state, children and servants</i></p>
<p><i>Which do but what they should, in doing</i> nothing,</p>
<p>Save <i>toward</i> your love and honour.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>We do but perform our duty when we contract all our views to
your service, when we act with <i>no other</i> principle than
regard to <i>your love and honour</i>.</p>
<p>It is probable that this passage was first corrupted by writing
<i>safe</i> for <i>save</i>, and the lines then stood thus:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>doing nothing</i></p>
<p><i>Safe toward your love and honour.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>which the next transcriber observing to be wrong, and yet not
being able to discover the real fault, altered to the present
reading.</p>
<p>Dr. Warburton has since changed <i>fiefs</i> to <i>fief'd</i>,
and Hanmer has altered <i>safe</i> to <i>shap'd</i>. I am afraid
none of us have hit the right word.</p>
<p>I.v.2 (420, 6) <i>by the perfected report</i>] By the best
intelligence. Dr. Warburton would read, <i>perfected</i>, and
explains <i>report</i> by <i>prediction</i>. Little regard can be
paid to an emendation that instead of clearing the sense, makes it
more difficult.</p>
<p>I.v.23 (420, 7) thoud'st have, great Glamis,/That which cries,
<i>Thus thou must do, if thou have it</i>] As the object of
Macbeth's desire is here introduced speaking of itself, it is
necessary to read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>thoud'st have, great Glamis,</i></p>
<p><i>That which cries</i>, thus thou must do, if thou have
<i>me</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I.v.39 (422, 8) The raven himself is hoarse] Dr. Warburton
reads,</p>

<p>&mdash;<i>The raven himself's</i> not <i>hoarse</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Yet I think the present words may stand. The messenger, says the
servant, had hardly breath <i>to make up his message</i>; to which
the lady answers mentally, that he may well want breath, such a
message would add hoarseness to the raven. That even the bird,
whose harsh voice is accustomed to predict calamities, could not
<i>croak the entrance of</i> Duncan but in a note of unwonted
harshness.</p>
<p>I.v.42 (422, 2) mortal thoughts] This expression signifies not

<p>I.v.47 (422, 3) nor keep peace between/The effect, and it!] The
intent of lady Macbeth evidently is to wish that no womanish
tenderness, or conscientious remorse, may hinder her purpose from
proceeding to effect; but neither this, nor indeed any other sense,
is expressed by the present reading, and therefore it cannot be
doubted that Shakespeare wrote differently, perhaps thus,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>That no compunctious visitings of nature</i></p>
<p><i>Shake my fell purpose, nor keep</i> pace <i>between</i></p>
<p><i>Th' effect, and it</i>.&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>To <i>keep</i> pace <i>between</i> may signify <i>to pass
between</i>, to <i>intervene</i>. <i>Pace</i> is on many occasions
a favourite of Shakespeare's. This phrase is indeed not usual in
this sease, but was it not its novelty that gave occasion to the
present corruption? [The sense is, <i>that no compunctious
visitings of nature</i> may prevail upon her, to give place in her
mind to <i>peaceful</i> thoughts, or to rest one moment in quiet,
from the hour of her purpose to its full completion in the effect.
REVISAL.] This writer thought himself perhaps very sagacious that
be found a meaning which nobody missed, the difficulty still
remains how such a meaning is made by the words. (see 1765, VI,
394, 6)</p>

of nature, the present time would be <i>ignorant</i>.</p>
<p>I.vi.3 (425,3) our gentle senses] <i>Senses</i> are nothing more
<i>than each man's sense</i>. <i>Gentle senses</i> is very elegant,
as it means <i>placid</i>, <i>calm</i>, <i>composed</i>, and
intimates the peaceable delight of a fine day. (see 1765,

<p>I.vi.7 (426,5) coigne of 'vantage] Convenient corner.</p>
<p>I.vi.13 (426,7) How you should bid god-yield as for your pains]
I believe <i>yield</i>, or, as it is in the folio of 1623,
<i>eyld</i>, is a corrupted contraction of <i>shield</i>. The wish
implores not <i>reward</i> but <i>protection</i>.</p>
<p>I.vii.1 (428,1) If it were <i>done</i>] A man of learning
recommends another punctuation:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>If it were done, when 'tis done, then 'twere well.</i></p>
<p><i>It were done quickly, if, &amp;c.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I.vii.2 (428,2) If the assassination/Could tramel up the
consequence] Of this soliloquy the meaning is not very clear; I
have never found the readers of Shakespeare agreeing about it. I
understand it thus,</p>
<p>"If that which I am about to do, when it is once <i>done</i> and
executed, were <i>done</i> and ended without any following effects,
it would then be best <i>to do it quickly</i>; if the murder could
terminate in itself, and restrain the regular course of
consequences, if <i>its success</i> could secure <i>its
surcease</i>, if being once done <i>successfully</i>, without
detection, it could <i>fix a period</i> to all vengeance and
enquiry, so that <i>this blow</i> might be all that I have to do,
and this anxiety all that I have to suffer; if this could be my
condition, even <i>here</i> in <i>this world</i>, in this
contracted period of temporal existence, on this narrow <i>bank</i>
in the ocean of eternity, <i>I would jump the life to come</i>, I
would venture upon the deed without care of any future state. But
this is one of <i>these cases</i> in which judgment is pronounced
and vengeance inflicted upon as <i>here</i> in our present life. We
teach others to do as we have done, and are punished by our own
example." (1773)</p>
<p>I.vii.4 (428,3) With his surcease, success] I think the
reasoning requires that we should read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>With its</i> success surcease.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I.vii.6 (429,4) shoal of time] This is Theobald's emendation,
undoubtedly right. The old edition has <i>school</i>, and Dr.
Warburton <i>shelve</i>.</p>

couriers of the air] [W: couriers] <i>Courier</i> is only
<i>runner</i>. <i>Couriers of air</i> are <i>winds</i>, air in
motion. <i>Sightless</i> is <i>invisible</i>.</p>
<p>I.vii.25 (430,8) That tears shall drown the wind] Alluding to
the remission of the wind in a shower.</p>
<p>I.vii.28 (430,9) <i>Enter Lady</i>] The arguments by which lady
Macbeth persuades her husband to commit the murder, afford a proof
of Shakespeare's knowledge of human nature. She urges the
excellence and dignity of courage, a glittering idea which has
dazzled mankind from age to age, and animated sometimes the
house-breaker, and sometimes the conqueror; but this sophism
Macbeth has for ever destroyed, by distinguishing true from false
fortitude, in a line and a half; of which it may almost be said,
that they ought to bestow immortality on the author, though all his
other productions had been lost:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>I dare do all that become a man,</i></p>
<p><i>Who dares do more, is none</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This topic, which has been always employed with too much
success, is used in this scene with peculiar propriety, to a
soldier by a woman. Courage is the distinguishing virtue of a
soldier, and the reproach of cowardice cannot be borne by any man
from a woman, without great impatience.</p>
<p>She then urges the oaths by which he had bound himself to murder
Duncan, another art of sophistry by which men have sometimes
deluded their consciences, and persuaded themselves that what would
be criminal in others is virtuous in them; this argument
Shakespeare, whose plan obliged him to make Macbeth yield, has not
confuted, though he might easily have shewn that a former
obligation could not be vacated by a latter: that obligations laid
on us by a higher power, could not be over-ruled by obligations
which we lay upon ourselves.</p>
<p>I.vii.41 (431,1)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;Whouldst thou have that,</p>
<p>Which then esteem'st the ornament of life,</p>
<p>And live a coward in thine own esteem?]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In this there seems to be no reasoning. I should read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Or <i>live a coward in thine own esteem</i>?</p>
</div>
</div>

alluded to is, <i>The cat loves fish, but dares not wet her feet,
Catus amat pisces, sed men vult tingere plantas</i>.</p>
<p>I.vii.64 (432,5) Will I with wine and wassel so convince] To
<i>convince</i> is in Shakespeare to <i>overpower</i> or
<i>subdue</i>, as in this play,</p>

<i>manquellers</i> being in the old language the term for which
<i>murderers</i> is now used.</p>
<p>II.i (434,8) <i>Enter Banquo, and Fleance with a torch before
him</i>] The place is not mark'd in the old edition, nor is it easy
to say where this encounter can be. It is not in the <i>hall</i>,
as the editors have all supposed it, for Banquo sees the sky; it is
not far from the bedchamber, as the conversation shews: it must be
in the inner court of the castle, which Banquo might properly cross
in his way to bed.</p>
<p>II.i.25 (435,2) If you shall cleave to my consent, Then 'tis,/It
shall make honour for you] Macbeth expressed his thought with
affected obscurity; he does not mention the royalty, though he
apparently has it in his mind, <i>If you shall cleave to my
consent</i>, if you shall concur with me when I determine to accept
the crown, <i>when 'tis</i>, when that happens which the prediction
promises, <i>it shall make honour for you</i>.</p>
<p>II.i.49 (437,6) Now o'er the one half world/Nature seems dead]
That is, <i>over our hemisphere all action and motion seem to have
ceased</i>. This image, which is perhaps the most striking that
poetry can produce, has been adopted by Dryden in his <i>Conquest
of Mexico</i>:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>All things are hush'd as Nature's self lay dead,</i></p>
<p><i>The mountains seem to nod their drowsy head;</i></p>
<p><i>The little birds in dreams their song repeat,</i></p>
<p><i>And sleeping flow'rs beneath the night dews sweat.</i></p>
<p><i>Even lust and envy sleep!</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>These lines, though so well known, I have transcribed, that the
contrast between them and this passage of Shakespeare may be more
accurately observed.</p>
<p>Night is described by two great poets, but one describes a night
of quiet, the other of perturbation. In the night of Dryden, all
the disturbers of the world are laid asleep; in that of
Shakespeare, nothing but sorcery, lust, and murder, is awake. He
that reads Dryden, finds himself lull'd with serenity, and disposed
to solitude and contemplation. He that peruses Shakspeare looks
round alarmed, and starts to find himself alone. One is the night
of a lover, the other, of a murderer.</p>
<p>II.i.52 (438,8)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;wither'd Murther,</p>
<p>&mdash;thus with hia stealthy pace,</p>
<p>With Tarquin's ravishing strides, tow'rds his design</p>
<p>moves like a ghost.&mdash;]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This was the reading of this passage [ravishing sides] in all
the editions before that of Mr. Pope, who for <i>sides</i>,
inserted in the text <i>strides</i>, which Mr. Theobald has tacitly
copied from him, though a more proper alteration might perhaps have
been made. A <i>ravishing stride</i> is an action of violence,
impetuosity, and tumult, like that of a savage rushing at his prey;
whereas the poet is here attempting to exhibit an image of secrecy
and caution, of anxious circumspection and guilty timidity, the
<i>stealthy pace</i> of a <i>ravisher</i> creeping into the chamber
of a virgin, and of an assassin approaching the bed of him whom he
proposes to murder, without awaking him; these he describes as
<i>moving like ghosts</i>, whose progression is so different from
<i>strides</i>, that it has been in all ages represented te be, as
Milton expresses it,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Smooth sliding without step</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This hemiatic will afford the true reading of this place, which
is, I think, to be corrected thus:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>and wither'd Murder</i>.</p>
<p>&mdash;<i>thus with his</i> stealthy <i>pace</i>.</p>
<p><i>With Tarquin ravishing</i>, slides <i>tow'rds his
design</i>,</p>
<p><i>Moves like a ghost</i>.&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>Tarquin</i> is in this place the general name of a ravisher,
and the sense is, Now is the time in which every one is a-sleep,
but those who are employed in wickedness; the witch who is
sacrificing to Hecate, and the ravisher, and the murderer, who,
like me, are stealing upon their prey.</p>
<p>When the reading is thus adjusted, he wishes with great
propriety, in the following lines, that the <i>earth</i> may not
<i>hear his steps</i>.</p>
<p>II.i.59 (439,3) And take the present horrour from the
time,/Which now suits with it] Of this passage an alteration was
once proposed by me, of which I have now a less favourable opinion,
yet will insert it, as it may perhaps give some hint to other
critics:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>And take the present horrour from the time,</i></p>
<p><i>Which now suits with it</i>.&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I believe every one that has attentively read this dreadful
soliloquy is disappointed at the conclusion, which, if not wholly
unintelligible, is, at least, obscure, nor can be explained into
any sense worthy of the authour. I shall therefore propose a slight
alteration:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>Thou sound and firm-set earth,</i></p>
<p><i>Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear</i></p>
<p><i>Thy very stones prate of my where-about,</i></p>
<p><i>And talk&mdash;the present horrour of the time!</i></p>
<p><i>That now suits with it</i>.&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Macbeth has, in the foregoing lines, disturbed his imagination
by enumerating all the terrors of the night; at length he is
wrought up to a degree of frenzy, that makes him afraid of some
supernatural discovery of his design, and calls out to the stones
not to betray him, not to declare where he walks, nor <i>to
talk</i>.&mdash;As he is going to say of what, he discovers the
absurdity of his suspicion, and pauses, but is again overwhelmed by
his guilt, and concludes, that such are the horrors of the present
night, that the stones may be expected to cry out against him:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>That <i>now suits with it</i>.&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>He observes in a subsequent passage, that on such occasions
<i>stones have been known to move</i>. It is now a very just and
strong picture of a man about to commit a deliberate murder under
the strongest conviction of the wickedness of his design. Of this
alteration, however, I do not now see much use, and certainly see
no necessity.</p>
<p>Whether to <i>take horrour from the time</i> means not rather to
<i>catch</i> <i>it</i> as communicated, than to <i>deprive the time
of horrour</i>, deserves te be considered.</p>
<p>II.ii.37 (443,6) sleave of care] A skein of silk is called a
<i>sleave</i> of silk, as I learned from Mr. Seward, the ingenious
editor of Beaumont and Fletcher.</p>
<p>II.ii.56 (444,8) gild the faces of the grooms withal,/For it
must seem their guilt] Could Shakespeare possibly mean to play upon
the similitude of <i>gild</i> and <i>guilt</i>.</p>
<p>II.iii.45 (447,5) I made a shift to cast him] To <i>cast him
up</i>, to ease my stomach of him. The equivocation is between
<i>cast</i> or <i>throw</i>, as a term of wrestling, and
<i>cast</i> or <i>cast up</i>.</p>

<p>Clamour'd the live-long night: some say the earth</p>
<p>Was feverous, and did shake]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Those lines I think should be rather regulated thus:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>prophecying with accents terrible,</i></p>
<p><i>Of dire combustions and cosfus'd events.</i></p>
<p><i>New-hatch'd to th' woful time, the obscure bird</i></p>
<p><i>Clamour'd the live-long night. Some say the earth</i></p>
<p><i>Was fev'rous and did shake.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>A <i>prophecy</i> of an <i>event new hatch'd</i>, seems to be a
<i>prophecy</i> of an <i>event past</i>. And <i>a prophecy new
hatch'd</i> is a wry expression. The term <i>new hatch'd</i> is
properly applicable to a <i>bird</i>, and that birds of ill omen
should be <i>new-hatch'd to the woful time</i>, that is, should
appear in uncommon numbers, is very consistent with the rest of the
prodigies here mentioned, and with the universal disorder into
which nature is described as thrown, by the perpetration of this
horrid murder. (see 1765, VI, 413, 7)</p>
<p>II.iii.117 (452,3) Here, lay Duncan,/His silver skin lac'd with
his golden blood] Mr. Pope has endeavoured to improve one of these
lines by substituting <i>goary blood</i> for <i>golden blood</i>;
but it may easily be admitted that he who could on such an occasion
talk of <i>lacing the silyer skin</i>, would <i>lace it</i> with
<i>golden blood</i>. No amendment can be made to this line, of
which every word is equally faulty, but by a general blot.</p>
<p>It is not improbable, that Shakespeare put these forced and
unnatural metaphors into the mouth of Macbeth as a mark of artifice
and dissimulation, to shew the difference between the studied
language of hypocrisy, and the natural outcries of sudden passion.
This whole speech so considered, is a remarkable instance of
judgment, as it consists entirely of antithesis and metaphor.</p>
<p>II.iii.122 (432,5) Unmannerly breech'd with gore] An
<i>unmannerly dagger</i>, and a <i>dagger breech'd</i>, or as in
some editions <i>breech'd with</i>, gore, are expressions not
easily to be understood. There are undoubtedly two faults in this
passage, which I have endeavored to take away by reading,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>daggers</i></p>
<p>Unmanly drench'd <i>with gore</i>:&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>I saw</i> drench'd <i>with the King's blood the fatal
daggers, not only instruments of murder but evidence of
cowardice</i>.</p>
<p>Each of these words might easily be confounded with that which I
have substituted for it, by a hand not exact, a casual blot, or a
negligent inspection, [W: Unmanly reech'd] Dr. Warburton has,
perhaps, rightly put <i>reach'd</i> for <i>breech'd</i>.</p>
<p>II.iii.138 (454,8)</p>
<div class="poem">

<p><i>Pretence</i> is not act, but <i>simulation</i>, a
<i>pretence</i> of the traitor, whoever he might be, to suspect
some other of the murder. I here fly to the protector of innocence
from any charge which, yet <i>undivulg'd</i>, the traitor may
pretend to fix upon me.</p>
<p>II.iii.147 (454,7) This murtherous shaft that's shot,/Hath not

person, has not yet taken effect.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>minions of</i> the <i>race</i>,</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>very probably, and very poetically.</p>
<p>II.iv.24 (456,1) What good could they pretend?] To
<i>pretend</i> is here to <i>propose to themselves</i>, to <i>set
before themselves</i> as a motive of action.</p>
<p>III.i.7 (457,2) As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine]
<i>Shine</i>, for appear with all the <i>lustre</i> of
<i>conspicuous</i> truth.</p>
<p>III.i.56 (459,4) as, it is said,/Mark Anthony's was by Caesar]
Though I would not often assume the critic's privilege of being
confident where certainty cannot be obtained, nor indulge myself
too far in departing from the established reading; yet I cannot but
propose the rejection of this passage, which I believe was an
insertion of some player, that having so much learning as to
discover to what Shakespeare alluded, was not willing that his
audience should be less knowing than himself, and has therefore
weakened the authour's sense by the intrusion of a remote and
useless image into a speech bursting from a man wholly possess'd
with his own present condition, and therefore not at leisure to
explain his own allusions to himself. If these words are taken
away, by which not only the thought but the numbers are injured,
the lines of Shakespeare close together without any traces of a
breach.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>My genius is rebuk'd. He chid the sisters.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This note was written before I was fully acquainted with
Shakespeare's manner, and I do not now think it of much weight; for
though the words, which I was once willing to eject, seem
interpolated, I believe they may still be genuine, and added by the
authour in his revision. The authour of the <i>Revisal</i> cannot
admit the measure to be faulty. There is only one foot, he says,
put for another. This is one of the effects of literature in minds
not naturally perspicacious. Every boy or girl finds the metre
imperfect, but the pedant comes to its defence with a tribrachys or
an anapaest, and sets it right at once by applying to one language
the rules of another. If we may be allowed to change feet, like the
old comic writers, it will not be easy to write a line not
metrical. To hint this once, is sufficient. (see 1765, VI, 424,
2)</p>
<p>III.i.65 (460,5) For Banquo's issue have I fil'd my mind] [W:
'filed] This mark of contraction is not necessary. To <i>file</i>
is in the bishop's <i>Bible</i>.</p>
<p>III.i.69 (460,6) the common enemy of man] It is always an
entertainment to an inquisitive reader, to trace a sentiment to its
original source; and therefore, though the term <i>enemy of
man</i>, applied to the devil, is in itself natural and obvious,
yet some may be pleased with being informed, that Shakespeare
probably borrowed it from the first lines of the Destruction of
Troy, a book which he is known to have read. This expression,
however, he might have had in many other places. The word
<i>fiend</i> signifies enemy.</p>
<p>III.i.71 (461,7) come, Fate, into the list,/And champion me to
the utterance!] This passage will be best explained by translating
it into the language from whence the only word of difficulty in it
is borrowed, "<i>Que la destin&eacute;e se rende en lice, et
qu'elle me donne un defi a l'outrance</i>." A challenge or a combat
<i>a l'outrance</i>, <i>to extremity</i>, was a fix'd term in the
law of arms, used when the combatants engaged with an <i>odium
internecinum, an intention to destroy each other</i>, in opposition
to trials of skill at festivals, or on other occasions, where the
contest was only for reputation or a prize. The sense therefore is,
<i>Let Fate, that has foredoom'd the exaltation of the sons of
Banquo, enter the lists against me, with the utmost animosity, in
defence of its own decrees, which I will endeavour to invalidate,
whatever be the danger</i>. [Johnson quotes Warburton's note] After
the former explication, Dr. Warburton was desirous to seem to do
something; and he has therefore made <i>Fate</i> the
<i>marshal</i>, whom I had made the <i>champion</i>, and has left
Macbeth to enter the lists without an opponent.</p>
<p>III.i.88 (462,9) Are you so gospell'd] Are you of that degree of
precise virtue? <i>Gospeller</i> was a name of contempt given by
the Papists to the Lollards, the puritans of early times, and the
precursors of <i>protestantism</i>.</p>
<p>III.i.94 (463,1) Showghes] <i>Showghes</i> are probably what we
now call <i>shocks</i>, demi-wolves, <i>lyciscae</i>; dogs bred
between wolves and dogs. (1773)</p>
<p>III.i.95 (463,2) the valued file] In this speech the word
<i>file</i> occurs twice, and seems in both places to have a
meaning different from its present use. The expression, <i>valued
file</i>, evidently means, a list or catalogue of value. A station
in the <i>file</i>, and not in the worst rank, may mean, a place in
the list of manhood, and not in the lowest place. But <i>file</i>
seems rather to mean in this place, a post of honour; the first
rank, in opposition to the last; a meaning which I have not
observed in any other place. (1773)</p>
<p>III.i.112 (465,2) So weary with disasters, tug'd with fortune]
<i>Tug'd with fortune</i> may be, <i>tug'd</i> or <i>worried</i> by
fortune.</p>

What is meant by <i>the spy of the time</i>, it will be found
difficult to explain; and therefore sense will be cheaply gained by
a slight alteration.&mdash;Macbeth is assuring the assassins that
they shall not want directions to find Banquo, and therefore
says,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>I will</i>&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Acquaint you with</i> a perfect spy <i>o' the time</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Accordingly a third murderer joins them afterwards at the place
of action.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Perfect</i> is <i>well instructed</i>, or <i>well
informed</i>, as in this play,</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Though in your state of honour I am</i> perfect.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>though I am <i>well acquainted</i> with your quality and rank.
[Warburton explained this as "the critical juncture"] How the
<i>critical juncture</i> is the <i>spy o' the time</i> I know not,
but I think my own conjecture right.</p>
<p>III.ii.38 (467,1) nature's copy's not eternal] The <i>copy</i>,
the <i>lease</i>, by which they hold their lives from nature, has
its time of termination limited.</p>
<p>III.iii.1 (469,6) But who did bid thee join with us?] The
meaning of this abrupt dialogue is this. The <i>perfect spy</i>,
mentioned by Macbeth in the foregoing scene, has, before they enter
upon the stage, given them the directions which were promised at
the time of their agreement; yet one of the murderers suborned
suspects him of intending to betray them; the other observes, that,
by his exact knowledge of <i>what they were to do</i>, he appears
to be employed by Macbeth, and needs not be mistrusted.</p>
<p>III.iv.1 (470,9) You know your own degrees, sit down: at
first,/And last the hearty welcome] As this passage stands [sit
down:/At first and last], not only the numbers are very imperfect,
but the sense, if any can be found, weak and contemptible. The
numbers will be improved by reading,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>sit down at first,</i></p>
<p><i>And last a hearty welcome</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>But for <i>last</i> should then be written <i>next</i>. I
believe the true reading is,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>You know your own degrees, sit down</i>.&mdash;<i>To
first</i></p>
<p><i>And last the hearty welcome</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>All of whatever degree, from the highest to the lowest, may be
assured that their visit is well received.</p>
<p>III.iv.14 (471,1) 'Tis better thee without, than he within] The
sense requires that this passage should be read thus:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>'Tis better</i> thee <i>without, than</i> him
<i>within</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>That is, <i>I am better pleased that the blood of Banquo should
be on thy face than in his body</i>.</p>
<p>The authour might mean, <i>It is better that Banquo's blood were
on thy face, than</i> he <i>in this room</i>. Expressions thus
imperfect are common in his works.</p>
<p>III.iv.33 (472,2) the feast is sold] The meaning is,&mdash;That
which ia not <i>given cheerfully</i>, cannot be called a
<i>gift</i>, it is something that must be paid for. (1773)</p>
<p>III.iv.57 (473,3) extend his passion] Prolong his suffering;
make his fit longer.</p>
<p>III.iv.60 (473,4) O proper stuff!] This speech is rather too
long for the circumstances in which it is spoken. It had begun
better at, <i>Shame itself</i>!</p>
<p>III.iv.63 (473,5)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Oh, these flaws, and starts,</p>
<p>(Impostors to true fear,) would well become</p>
<p>A woman's story at a winter's fire,</p>

</div>
</div>
<p><i>Flaws</i>, are <i>sudden gusts</i>. The authour perhaps
wrote,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>Those flaws and starts</i>,</p>
<p>Impostures true to fear <i>would well become</i>;</p>
<p><i>A woman's story</i>,&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>These symptoms of terrour and amazement might better become
<i>impostures true</i> only <i>to fear, might become a coward at
the recital of such falsehoods as no man could credit, whose
understanding was not weaken'd by his terrours; tales told by a
woman over a fire on the authority of her grandam</i>.</p>
<p>III.iv.76 (474,6) Ere human statute purg'd the gentle weal] The
<i>gentle weal</i>, is, the <i>peaceable community</i>, the state
made quiet and safe by <i>human statutes</i>.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Mollia securae peragebant otia gentes</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>III.iv.92 (475,7) And all to all] I once thought it should be
<i>hail</i> to all, but I now think that the present reading is
right.</p>
<p>III.iv.105 (475,8) If trembling I inhabit] This is the original
reading, which Mr. Pope changed to <i>inhibit</i>, which
<i>inhibit</i> Dr. Warburton interprets <i>refuse</i>. The old
reading may stand, at least as well as the emendation. Suppose we
read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>If trembling I</i> evade <i>it</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>III.iv.110 (476,9) Can such things be,/And overcome us, like a
summer's cloud,/Without our special wonder?] [W: Can't] The
alteration is introduced by a misinterpretation. The meaning is not
that <i>these things are like a summer-cloud</i>, but can such
wonders as these pass over us without wonder, as a casual summer
cloud passes over us.</p>
<p>III.iv.112 (477,1) You make me strange/Even to the disposition
that I owe] You produce in me an <i>alienation of mind</i>, which
is probably the expression which our author intended to
paraphrase.</p>
<p>III.iv.124 (477,2) Augurs, and understood relations] By the word
<i>relation</i> is understood the <i>connection</i> of effects with
causes; to <i>understand relations</i> as <i>an angur</i>, is to
know how these things <i>relate</i> to each other, which have no
visible combination or dependence.</p>
<p>III.iv.141 (479,5) You lack the season of all natures, sleep] I
take the meaning to be, <i>you want sleep</i>, which
<i>seasons</i>, or gives the relish to <i>all nature</i>.
<i>Indiget somni vitae condimenti</i>.</p>
<p>III.v.24 (480,8) vaporous drop, profound] That is, a drop that
has <i>profound</i>, <i>deep</i>, or <i>hidden</i> qualities.</p>
<p>III.v.26 (480,9) slights] Arts; subtle practices.</p>
<p>III.vi (481,1) <i>Enter Lenox, and another Lord</i>] As this
tragedy, like the rest of Shakespeare's, is perhaps overstocked
with personages, it is not easy to assign a reason why a nameless
character should be introduced here, since nothing is said that
might not with equal propriety have been put into the mouth of any
other disaffected man. I believe therefore that in the original
copy it was written with a very common form of contraction Lenox
and An. for which the transcriber, instead of Lenox and Angus, set
down Lenox and <i>another Lord</i>. The author had indeed been more
indebted to the transcriber's fidelity and diligence had he
committed no errors of greater importance.</p>
<p>III.vi.36 (482,3) and receive free honours] [<i>Free</i> for
grateful. WARBURTON.] How can <i>free</i> be <i>grateful</i>? It
may be either honours <i>freely bestowed</i>, not purchased by
crimes; or honours <i>without slavery</i>, without dread of a
tyrant.</p>
<p>IV.i (484,5) As this is the chief scene of enchantment in the
play, it is proper in this place to observe, with how much judgment
Shakespeare has selected all the circumstances of his infernal
ceremonies, and how exactly he has conformed to common opinions and
traditions:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The usual form in which familiar spirits are reported to
converse with witches, is that of a cat. A witch, who was tried
about half a century before the time of Shakespeare, had a cat
named Rutterkin, as the spirit of one of these witches was
Grimalkin; and when any mischief was to be done she used to bid
Rutterkin <i>go and fly</i>, but once when she would have sent
Rutterkin to torment a daughter of the countess of Rutland, instead
of <i>going</i> or <i>flying</i>, he only cried <i>mew</i>, from
whence she discovered that the lady was out of his power, the power
of witches being not universal, but limited, as Shakespeare has
taken care to inculcate:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Though his bark cannot be lost,</i></p>
<p><i>Yet it shall be tempest-tost.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The common afflictions which the malice of witches produced were
melancholy, fits, and loss of flesh, which are threatened by one of
Shakespeare's witches:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Weary sev'n nights, nine times nine,</i></p>
<p><i>Shall he dwindle, peak, and pine.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It was likewise their practice to destroy the cattle of their
neighbours, and the farmers have to this day many ceremonies to
secure their cows and other cattle from witchcraft; but they seem
to have been most suspected of malice against swine. Shakespeare
has accordingly made one of his witches declare that she has been
<i>killing swine</i>, and Dr. Harsenet observes, that about that
time, <i>a sow could not be ill of the measles, nor a girl of the
sullens, but some old woman was charged with witchcraft</i>.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Toad, that under the cold stone,</i></p>
<p><i>Days and night has, thirty-one,</i></p>
<p><i>Swelter'd venom sleeping got;</i></p>
<p><i>Boil thou first i'the charm'd pot</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Toads have likewise long lain under the reproach of being by
some means accessory to witchcraft, for which reason Shakespeare,
in the first scene of this play, calls one of the spirits Padocke
or Toad, and now takes care to put a toad first into the pot. When
Vaninus was seized at Theleuse, there was found at his lodgings
<i>ingens Bufo Vitro inclusus, a great toad shut in a vial</i>,
upon which those that prosecuted him, <i>Veneficium exprebrabent,
charged him</i>, I suppose, <i>with witchcraft</i>.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Fillet of fenny snake,</i></p>
<p><i>In the cauldron boil and bakae:</i></p>
<p><i>Eye of newt, and toe of frog;&mdash;</i></p>
<p><i>For a charm, &amp;c</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The propriety of these ingredients may be known by consulting
the books <i>de Viribus Animalium</i> and <i>de Mirabilibus
Mundi</i>, ascribed to Albertus Magnus, in which the reader, who
has time and credulity, may discover very wonderful secrets.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Finger of birth-strangled babe,</i></p>
<p><i>Ditch deliver'd by a drab</i>;&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It has been already mentioned in the law against witches, that
they are supposed to take up dead bodies to use in enchantments,
which was confessed by the woman whom king James examined, and who
had of a dead body that was divided in one of their assemblies, two
fingers for her share. It is observable that Shakespeare, on this
great occasion, which involves the fate of a king, multiplies all
the circumstanaces of horror. The babe, whose finger is used, must
be strangled in its birth; the grease must not only be human, but
must have dropped from a gibbet, the gibbet of a murderer; and even
the sow, whose blood is used, must have offended nature by
devouring her own farrow. These are touches of judgment and
genius.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>And now about the cauldron sing&mdash;</i></p>
<p><i>Black spirits and white,</i></p>
<p class="i2"><i>Blue spirits and grey,</i></p>
<p><i>Mingle, mingle, mingle,</i></p>
<p><i>You that mingle say</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>And in a former part,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>weyward sisters, hand in hand,&mdash;</i></p>
<p><i>Thus do go about, about.</i></p>
<p><i>Thrice to thine, and thrice to mine.</i></p>
<p><i>And thrice again to make up nine!</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>These two passages I have brought together, because they both
seem subject to the objection of too much levity for the solemnity
of enchantment, and may both be shewn, by one quotation from
Camden's account of Ireland, to be founded upon a practice really
observed by the uncivilised natives of that country: "When any one
gets a fall, <i>says the informer of Camden</i>, he starts up, and,
<i>turning three times to the right</i>, digs a hole in the earth;
for they imagine that there is a spirit in the ground, and if he
falls sick in two or three days, they send one of their women that
is skilled in that way to the place, where she says, I call thee
from the east, west, north, and south, from the groves, the woods,
the rivers, and the fens, from the fairies <i>red, black,
white</i>." There was likewise a book written before the time of
Shakespeare, describing, amongst other properties, the
<i>colours</i> of spirits.</p>
<p>Many other circumstances might be particularised, in which
Shakespeare has shown his judgment and his knowledge.</p>
<p>IV.i.53 (489,6) yesty waves] That is, <i>foaming</i> or
<i>frothy waves</i>.</p>
<p>IV.i.88 (491,1) the round/And top of sovereignty?] This
<i>round</i> is that part of the crown that encircles the head. The
<i>top</i> is the ornament that rises above it.</p>
<p>IV.i.95 (492,3) Who can impress the forest] i.e. who can command
the forest to serve him like a soldier impress'd. (1773)</p>
<p>IV.i.97 (492,4) Rebellious head, rise never] Mr. Theobald, who
first proposed this change ["head" for "dead"] rightly observes,
that <i>head</i> means <i>host</i>, or power.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>Douglas and the rebels met,</i></p>
<p><i>A mighty and a fearful</i> head <i>they are</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>And again,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>His divisions&mdash;are in three heads</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>IV.i.113 (493,6) Thy crown does sear mine eye-balls] The
expression of Macbeth, that the <i>crown</i> sears <i>his</i>
eye-balls, is taken from the method formerly practised of
destroying the sight of captives or competitors, by holding a
burning bason before the eye, which dried up its humidity. Whence
the Italian, <i>abacinare</i>, to <i>blind</i>.</p>
<p>IV.i.113 (493,7) And thy air,/Thou other gold-bound brow, is
like the first:&mdash;/A third is like the former] In former
editions,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>and thy</i> hair,</p>
<p><i>Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first</i>:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>A third is like the former</i>:&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>As Macbeth expected to see a train of kings, and was only
enquiring from what race they would proceed, he could not be
surprised that the <i>hair</i> of the second was <i>bound with
gold</i> like that of the first; he was offended only that the
second resembled the first, as the first resembled Banquo, and
therefore said,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>and thy</i> air,</p>
<p><i>Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This Dr. Warburton has followed.</p>
<p>IV.i.144 (495,2) Time, thou anticipat'st my dread exploits] To
<i>anticipate</i> is here to <i>prevent</i>, by taking away the
opportunity.</p>
<p>IV.ii.9 (496,3) He wants the natural touch] Natural sensibility.
He is not touched with natural affection.</p>
<p>IV.ii.71 (498,7) To do worse to you, were fell cruelty] To do
<i>worse</i> is, to let her and her children be destroyed without
warning.</p>
<p>IV.iii.2 (500,9) Let us rather/Hold fast the mortal sword; and,
like good men,/ Bestride our down-faln birthdom] In former
editions,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Let us rather</i></p>
<p><i>Hold fast the mortal sword; and, like good men,</i></p>
<p><i>Bestride our</i> downfal birthdoom.&mdash;]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>He who can discover what is meant by him that earnestly exhorts
him to <i>bestride</i> his <i>downfal birth-doom</i>, is at liberty
to adhere to the present text; but it is probable that Shakespeare
wrote,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>like good men,</i></p>
<p><i>Bestride our</i> downfaln birthdom&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The allusion is to a man from whom something valuable is about
to be taken by violence, and who, that he may defend it without
incombrance, lays it on the ground, and stands over it with his
weapon in his hand. Our birthdom, or birthright, says he, lies on
the ground, let us, like men who are to fight for what is dearest
to them, not abandon it, but stand over it and defend it. This is a
strong picture of obstinate resolution. So Falstaff says to
Hal.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>When I am down, if thou wilt</i> bestride me, <i>so</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>Birthdom</i> for <i>birthright</i> is formed by the same
analogy with <i>masterdom</i> in this play, signifying the
<i>privileges</i> or <i>rights</i> of a <i>master</i>.</p>
<p>Perhaps it might be <i>birth-dame</i> for <i>mother</i>; let us
stand over our <i>mother</i> that lies bleeding on the ground.</p>
<p>IV.iii.19 (501,4) A good and virtuous nature may recoil/In an
imperial charge] A good mind may <i>recede</i> from goodness in the
execution of a <i>royal commission</i>.</p>
<p>IV.iii.23 (501,5) Though all things foul would wear the brows of
grace,/Yet grace must look still so] This is not very clear. The
meaning perhaps is this:&mdash;<i>My suspicions cannot injure you,
if you be virtuous, by supposing that a traitor may put on your
virtuous appearance. I do not say that your virtuous appearance
proves you a traitor; for virtue must wear its proper form, though
that form be often counterfeited by villany</i>.</p>
<p>IV.iii.26 (502,6) Why in that rawness left you wife and
children] Without previous provision, without due preparation,
without <i>maturity</i> of counsel.</p>
<p>IV.iii.33 (502,7) Wear thou thy wrongs] That is, <i>Poor
country, wear thou thy wrongs</i>.</p>
<p>IV.iii.69 (503,1) Sudden, malicious] [<i>Sudden</i>, for
capricious. WARBUR.] Rather violent, passionate, hasty.</p>
<p>IV.iii.85 (504,2) Than summer seeming lust] When I was younger
and bolder I corrected it thus,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Than fume, or seething lust</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>that is, Than angry passion, or boiling lust. (1773)</p>
<p>IV.iii.135 (506,4) All ready at a point] [W: at appoint] There
is no need of change.</p>
<p>IV.iii.136 (506,5) and the chance of goodness/Be like our
warranted quarrel!] The <i>chance of goodness</i>, as it is
commonly read, conveys no sense. If there be not some more
important errour in the passage, it should at least be pointed
thus:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>and the chance, of goodness,</i></p>
<p><i>Be like our warranted quarrel</i>!&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>That is, may the event be, of the goodness of heaven, [<i>pro
justitia divina</i>] answerable to the cause.</p>
<p>The author of the <i>Revisal</i> conceives the sense of the
passage to be rather this: <i>And may the success of that goodness,
which is about to exert itself in my behalf, be such as may be
equal to the justice of my quarrel</i>.</p>
<p>But I am inclined to believe that Shakespeare wrote,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;and the chance, O goodness,</p>
<p>Be like our warranted quarrel!&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This some of his transcribers wrote with a small <i>o</i>, which
another imagined to mean <i>of</i>. If we adopt this reading, the
sense will be, <i>and O thou sovereign Goodness, to whom we now
appeal, may our fortune answer to our cause</i>. (see 1765, VI,
462, 7)</p>
<p>IV.iii.170 (508,9) A modern ecstacy] I believe <i>modern</i> is
only <i>foolish</i> or <i>trifling</i>.</p>
<p>IV.iii.196 (509,2), fee-grief] A peculiar sorrow; a grief that
hath a single owner. The expression is, at least to our ears, very
harsh.</p>
<p>IV.iii.216 (511,4) He has no children] It has been observed by
an anonymous critic, that this is not said of Macbeth, who had
children, but of Malcolm, who having none, supposes a father.</p>
<p>V.i.86 (515,8) My mind she has mated] [Conquer'd or subdued.
POPE.] Rather astonished, confounded.</p>
<p>V.ii.24 (516,1) When all that is within him does condemn/Itself,
for being there?] That is, when all the faculties of the mind are
employed in self-condemnation.</p>
<p>V.iii.1 (516,2) Bring me no more reports] <i>Tell me not any
more of desertions&mdash;Let all ny subjects leave me&mdash;I am
safe till,</i> &amp;c.</p>
<p>V.iii.8 (517,3) English Epicures] The reproach of Epicurism, on
which Mr. Theobald has bestowed a note, is nothing more than a
natural invective uttered by an inhabitant of a barren country,
against, those who have more opportunities of luxury.</p>
<p>V.iii.22 (518,6) my way of life/Is fall'n into the sear] As
there is no relation between the <i>way of life</i>, and <i>fallen
into the sear</i>, I am inclined to think that the W is only an M
inverted, and that it was originally written,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>my</i> May <i>of life</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>I am now passed from the spring to the autumn of my days, but
I am without those comforts that should succeed the spriteliness of
bloom, and support me in this melancholy season.</i></p>
<p>The authour has <i>May</i> in the same sense elsewhere.</p>
<p>V.iv.8 (521,1) the confident tyrant/Keeps still in Dunsinane,
and will endure/Our setting down before't] He was <i>confident</i>
of success; so <i>confident</i> that he would not fly, but endure
their <i>setting down</i> before his castle.</p>
<p>V.iv.11 (521,2) For where there is advantage to be given,/ Both
more and less have given him the revolt] The impropriety of the
expression, <i>advantage to be given</i>, and the disagreeable
repetition of the word <i>given</i> in the next line, incline me to
read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>where there is</i> a 'vantage <i>to be</i> gone,</p>
<p><i>Both more and less have given him the revolt.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>Advantage or 'vantage</i>, in the time of Shakespeare,
signified <i>opportunity</i>. <i>He shut up himself and his
soldiers</i>, (says Malcolm) <i>in the castle, because when there
is an opportunity to be gone they all desert him</i>.</p>
<p><i>More and less</i> is the same with <i>greater and less</i>.
So in the interpolated <i>Mandeville</i>, a book of that age, there
is a chapter of <i>India the More and the Less</i>.</p>
<p>V.iv.20 (522,4) arbitrate]&mdash;<i>arbitrate</i> is
<i>determine</i>.</p>
<p>V.v.11 (523,3) fell of hair] My hairy part, my
<i>capillitium</i>. <i>Fell</i> is <i>skin</i>.</p>
<p>V.v.17 (523,7) She should have dy'd hereafter;/ There would have
been a time for such a word] This passage has very justly been
suspected of being corrupt. It is not apparent for what <i>word</i>
there would have been a <i>time</i>, and that there would or would
not be a <i>time</i> for any <i>word</i> seems not a consideration
of importance sufficient to transport Macbeth into the following
exclamation. I read therefore,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>She should have dy'd hereafter.</i></p>
<p><i>There would have been a time for&mdash;such a</i>
world!&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Tomorrow</i>, &amp;c.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It is a broken speech in which only part of the thought is
expressed, and may be paraphrased thus: <i>The queen is dead</i>.
Macbeth. <i>Her death should have been deferred to some more
peaceful hour; had she liv'd longer</i>, there would at length have
been a time for the <i>honours due to her as a queen, and that
respect which I owe her for her fidelity and love. Such is the</i>
world&mdash;such is the condition of human life, that we always
think to-morrow <i>will be happier than to-day, but to-morrow and
to-morrow steals over us unenjoyed and unregarded, and we still
linger in the same expectation to the moment appointed for our end.
All these days, which have thus passed away, have sent multitudes
of fools to the grave, who were engrossed by the same dream of
future felicity, and, when life was departing from them, were, like
me, reckoning on to-morrow</i>.</p>
<p>Such was once my conjecture, but I am now less confident.
Macbeth might mean, that there would have been a more convenient
<i>time</i> for such a <i>word</i>, for such <i>intelligence</i>,
and so fall into the following reflection. We say we send
<i>word</i> when we give intelligence.</p>
<p>V.v.21 (524,8) To the last syllable of recorded time]
<i>Recorded time</i> seems to signify the time fixed in the decrees
of Heaven for the period of life. The <i>record</i> of
<i>futurity</i> is indeed no accurate expression, but as we only
know transactions past or present, the language of men affords no
term for the volumes of prescience, in which future events may be
supposed to be written.</p>
<p>V.v.23 (524,9) The way to dusty death] <i>Dusty</i> is a very
natural epithet. The second folio has,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>The way to</i> study <i>death</i>.&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>which Mr. Upton prefers, but it is only an errour by an
accidental transposition of the types.</p>
<p>V.v.42 (525,2) I pull in resolution, and begin/To doubt the
equivocation of the fiend,/ That lies like truth] Though this is
the reading of all the editions, yet, as it is a phrase without
either example, elegance or propriety, it is surely better to
read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>I</i> pall <i>in resolution,&mdash;</i></p>
<p><i>I languish in my constancy, my confidence begins to forsake
as</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It is scarcely necessary to observe how easily <i>pall</i> might
be changed into <i>pull</i> by a negligent writer, or mistaken for
it by an unskilful printer. With this emendation Dr. Warburton and
Mr. Heath concur. (see 1765, VI,478,8)</p>
<p>V.viii.9 (529,3) the intrenchant air] That is, air which cannot
be cut.</p>
<p>V.viii.20 (529,5) That palter with us in a double sense] That
<i>shuffle</i> with ambiguous expressions.</p>
<p>V.viii.48 (531,7) Had I as many sons as I have hairs, I would
not wish them to a fairer death]</p>
<p>This incident is thus related from Henry of Huntingdon by Camden
in his <i>Remains</i>, from which our authour probably copied
it.</p>
<p>When Seyward, the martial earl of Northumberland, understood
that his son, whom he had sent in service against the Scotchmen,
was slain, he demanded whether his wounds were in the fore part or
hinder part of his body. When it was answered, in the fore part, he
replied, "I am right glad; neither wish I any other death to me or
mine."</p>
<p>General Observation. This play is deservedly celebrated for the
propriety of its fictions, and solemnity, grandeur, and variety of
its action; but it has no nice discriminations of character, the
events are too great to admit the influence of particular
dispositions, and the course of the action necessarily determines
the conduct of the agents.</p>
<p>The danger of ambition is well described; and I know not whether
it may not be said in defence of some parts which now seem
improbable, that, in Shakespeare's time, it was necessary to warn
credulity against vain and illusive predictions.</p>
<p>The passions are directed to their true end. Lady Macbeth is
merely detested; and though the courage of Macbeth preserves some
esteem, yet every reader rejoices at his fall.</p>
<h3>Vol. VII</h3>
<h2>CORIOLANUS</h2>
<p>1.i.19 (292,1) but they think, we are too dear] They think that
the charge of maintaining us is more than we are worth.</p>
<p>I.i.23 (292,3) ere we become rakes] It is plain that, in our
authour's time, we had the proverb, <i>as lean as a rake</i>. Of
this proverb the original is obscure. <i>Rake</i> now signifies a
<i>dissolute man</i>, a man worn out with disease and debauchery.
But the signification is, I think, much more modern than the
proverb. <i>Raekel</i>, in Islandick, is said to mean a
<i>cur-dog</i>, and this was probably the first use among us of the
word <i>rake</i>; <i>as lean as a rake</i> is, therefore, as lean
as it dog too worthless to be fed.</p>
<p>1.i.94 (294,4) I will venture/To scale't a little more]
[Warburton had taken Theobald to task for emending to "stale't",
offering two quotations to prove that "scale" meant "apply."]
Neither of Dr. Warburton's examples afford a sense congruous to the
present occasion. In the passage quoted, to <i>scale</i> may be to
<i>weigh</i> and <i>compare</i>, but where do we find that
<i>scale</i> is to <i>apply</i>? If we <i>scale</i> the two
criticks, I think Theobald has the advantage.</p>
<p>I.i.97 (295,5) fob off our disgraces with a tale]
<i>Disgraces</i> are <i>hardships, injuries</i>.</p>
<p>I.i.104 (295,6) where the other instruments] <i>Where</i> for
<i>whereas</i>.</p>
<p>I.i.112 (296,7) Which ne'er came from the lungs] with a smile
not indicating pleasure, but contempt.</p>
<p>I.i.120 (296,9) The counsellor heart] The heart was anciently
esteemed the seat of prudence. <i>Homo cordatum</i> is a <i>prudent
man</i>.</p>
<p>I.i.163 (297,1) Thou rascal, that art worst in blood, to ruin,/
Lead'st first, to win some 'vantage] I think, we may better read,
by an easy change, <i>Thou rascal that art worst, in blood, to</i>
ruin [to run] <i>Lead'st first, to win</i>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Thou that art the meanest by birth, art the foremost to lead thy
fellows <i>to ruin</i>, in hope of some advantage. The meaning,
however, is perhaps only this, Thou that art a hound, or running
dog of the lowest breed, lead'st the pack, when any thing is to be
gotten. (see 1765, VI, 493, 1)</p>
<p>I.i.172 (298,4) What would you have, ye curs,/ That like not
peace, nor war? The one affrights you,/ The other makes you proud]
[W: likes] That <i>to like</i> is <i>to please</i>, every one
knows, but in that sense it is as hard to say why peace should not
<i>like</i> the people, as, in the other sense, why the people
should not <i>like</i> peace. The truth is, that Coriolanus does
not use the two sentences consequentially, but reproaches them with
unsteadiness, then with their other occasional vices.</p>
<p>I.i.202 (300,6) I'd make a quarry/With thousands] Why a quarry?
I suppose, not because he would pile them square, but because he
would give them for carrion to the birds of prey.</p>
<p>I.i.215 (300,7) To break the heart of generosity] To give the
final blow to the <i>nobles</i>. <i>Generosity</i> is <i>high
birth</i>.</p>
<p>I.i.231 (301,8) 'tis true, that yon have lately told us./The
Volscians are in arms] Coriolanus had been but just told himself
that <i>the Volscians were in arms</i>. The meaning is, <i>The
intelligence which you gave us some little time ago of the designs
of the Volscians is now verified; they are in arms.</i></p>
<p>I.i.255 (302,8) Your valour puts well forth] That is, You have
in this mutiny shewn fair blossoms of valour.</p>
<p>I.i.260 (303,9) to gird. To <i>sneer</i>, to <i>gibe</i>. So
Falstaff uses the noun, when he says, <i>every man has a</i> gird
<i>at me</i>.</p>
<p>I.i.281 (304,3) in what fashion,/More than his singularity he
goes/ Upon this present action] We will learn what he is to do,
besides <i>going himself</i>; what are his powers, and what is his
appointment.</p>
<p>I.ii.28 (305,4) for the remove/Bring up your army] [W:'fore
they] I do not see the nonsense or impropriety of the old reading.
Says the senator to Aufidius, <i>Go to your troops, we will
garrison Corioli</i>. If the Romans besiege us, bring up your army
<i>to remove them</i>. If any change should be made, I would
read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>for</i> their <i>remove</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I.iii.16 (307,5) brows bound with oak] The crown given by the
Romans to him that saved the life of a citizen, which was accounted
more honourable than any other.</p>
<p>I.iv.14 (311,9) nor a man that fears you less than he,/That's
lesser than a little] The sense requires it to be read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>nor a man that fears you</i> more <i>than he</i>,</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Or more probably,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>nor a man</i> but <i>fears you less than he,</i></p>
<p><i>That's lesser than a little</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I.v.5 (314,4) prize their hours] In the first edition it is,
<i>prize their</i> hours. I know not who corrected it [to <i>prize
their honours</i>]. A modern editor, who had made such an
improvement, would have spent half a page in ostentation of his
sagacity.</p>
<p>I.vi.36 (317,6) Ransoming him, or pitying] i.e. <i>remitting his
ransom</i>.</p>
<p>I.vi.61 (318,8) swords advanc'd] That is, swords lifted
high.</p>
<p>I.vi.83 (319,9) Please you to march,/And four shall quickly draw
out my command,/Which men are best inclin'd] I cannot but suspect
this passage of corruption. Why should they <i>march</i>, that
<i>four</i> might select those that were <i>best inclin'd</i>? How
would their inclinations be known? Who were the <i>four</i> that
should select them? Perhaps, we may read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>Please you to march,</i></p>
<p><i>And</i> fear <i>shall quickly draw out</i> of <i>my
command,</i></p>
<p><i>Which men are</i> least <i>inclin'd</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It is easy to conceive that, by a little negligence, <i>fear</i>
might be changed to <i>four</i>, and <i>least</i> to <i>best</i>.
Let us march, and that fear which incites desertion will free my
army from cowards. (see 1765, VI, 512, 1)</p>
<p>I.viii.11 (320,1) Wert thou the Hector,/That was the whip of
your bragg'd progeny] The Romans boasted themselves descended from
the Trojans, how then was Hector the <i>whip of their progeny</i>?
It must mean the whip with which the Trojans scourged the Greeks,
which cannot be but by a very unusual construction, or the authour
must have forgotten the original of the Romans; unless <i>whip</i>
has some meaning which includes <i>advantage</i> or
<i>superiority</i>, as we say, <i>he has the</i> whip-hand, for
<i>he has the</i> advantage.</p>
<p>I.viii.14 (321,2) you have sham'd me/In your condemned seconds]
For <i>condemned</i>, we may read <i>contemned</i>. You have, to my
shane, sent me help <i>which I despise</i>.</p>
<p>I.ix.12 (321,4) Here is the steed, we the caparisons!] This is
an odd encomium. The meaning is, <i>this man performed the action,
and we only filled up the show</i>.</p>
<p>I.ii.14 (322,5) a charter to extol] A privilege to praise her
own son.</p>
<p>I.ix.29 (322,6) Should they not] That is, <i>not be
remembered</i>.</p>
<p>I.ix.72 (325,9) To the fairness of any power] [<i>Fairness</i>,
for <i>utmost</i>. WARE.] I know not how <i>fairness</i> can mean
<i>utmost</i>. When two engage on <i>equal</i> terms, we say it is
<i>fair</i>; <i>fairness</i> may therefore be <i>equality; in
proportion equal to my power</i>.</p>
<p>I.ix.76 (325,1) The best] The <i>chief</i> men of Corioli.</p>
<p>I.x.5 (326,3) Being a Volsce, be that I am] It may be just
observed, that Shakespeare calls the <i>Volsci, Volsces</i>, which
the modern editors have changed to the modern termination
[Volscian]. I mention it here, because here the change has spoiled
the measure. <i>Being a</i> Volsce, <i>be that I am. Condition</i>.
[Steevans restored <i>Volsce</i> in the text.]</p>
<p>I.x.17 (326,2) My valour's poison'd,/With only suffering stain
by him, for him/ Shall flie out of itself] To mischief him, my
valour should <i>deviate from</i> its own native generosity.</p>
<p>I.x.25 (327,4) At home, upon my brother's guard] In my own
house, with my brother posted to protect him.</p>
<p>II.i.8 (328,5) Pray you, who does the wolf love?] When the
tribune, in reply to Menenius's remark, on the people's hate of
Coriolanus, had observed that even <i>beasts know their
friends</i>, Menenius asks, <i>whom does the wolf love</i>?
implying that there are beasts which love nobody, and that among
those beasts are the people.</p>
<p>II.i.43 (329,6) towards the napes of your necks] With allusion
to the fable, which says, that every man has a bag hanging before
him, in which he puts his neighbour's faults, and another behind
him, in which he stows his own.</p>
<p>II.i.56 (330,7) one that converses more with the buttock of the
night, than with the forehead of the morning] Rather a late lier
down than an early riser.</p>
<p>II.i.84 (330,1) set up the bloody flag against all patience]
That is, declare war against patience. There is not wit enough in
this satire to recompense its grossness.</p>
<p>II.i.105 (331,2) herdsmen of beastly Plebeians] As kings are
called [Greek: poimenes laon].</p>
<p>II.i.115 (331,3) Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee] [W:
cup] Shakespeare so often mentions throwing up caps in this play,
that Menenius may be well enough supposed to throw up his cap in
thanks to Jupiter.</p>
<p>II.i.146 (333,4) possest of this?] <i>Possest</i>, in our
authour's language, is fully informed.</p>
<p>II.i.178 (334,6) Which being advanc'd, declines] Volumnia, in
her boasting strain, says, that her son to kill his enemy, has
nothing to do but to lift his hand up and let it fall.</p>
<p>II.i.232 (337,3) Commit the war of white and damask, in/Their
nicely gawded cheeks] [W: wars] Has the commentator never heard of
roses <i>contending</i> with lilies for the empire of a lady's
cheek? The <i>opposition</i> of colours, though not the
<i>commixture</i>, may be called a war.</p>
<p>II.i.235 (338,1) As if that whatsoever God] That is, <i>as if
that God who leads him, whatsoever</i> God he be.</p>
<p>II.i.241 (338,2) From where he should begin, and end] Perhaps it
should be read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>From where he should begin</i> t'an <i>end</i>.&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>II.i.247 (338,3) As he is proud to do't] [I should rather think
the author wrote <i>prone</i>: because the common reading is scarce
sense or English. WARBURTON.] <i>Proud to do</i>, is the same as,
<i>proud of doing</i>, very plain sense, and very common
English.</p>
<p>II.i.285 (340,4) carry with us ears and eyes] That is, let us
observe what passes, but keep our hearts fixed on our design of
crushing Coriolanus.</p>
<p>II.ii.19 (340,5) he wav'd indifferently] That is, <i>he would
wave indifferently</i>.</p>
<p>II.ii.29 (341,6) supple and courteous to the people; bonnetted]
The sense, I think, requires that we should read,
<i>unbonnetted</i>. Who have risen only by <i>pulling off their
hats</i> to the people. <i>Bonnetted</i> may relate to
<i>people</i>, but not without harshness.</p>
<p>II.ii.57 (342,7) Your loving motion toward the common body] Your
kind interposition with the common people.</p>
<p>II.ii.64 (342,9) That's off, that's off] That is, that is
nothing to the purpose.</p>
<p>II.ii.82 (343,1) how can he flatter] The reasoning of Menenius
is this: How can he be expected to practice flattery to others, who
abhors it so much, that he cannot bear it even when offered to
himself.</p>
<p>II.ii.92 (343,2) When Tarquin made a head for Rome] When
Tarquin, who had been expelled, <i>raised a power</i> to recover
Rome.</p>
<p>II.ii.113 (344,6) every motion/Was tim'd with dying cries] The
cries of the slaughter'd regularly followed his motions, as musick
and a dancer accompany each ether.</p>
<p>II.ii.115 (345,7) The mortal gate] The gate that was made the
scene of death.</p>
<p>II.ii.127 (345,8) He cannot but with measure fit the honours]
That is, no honour will be too great far him; he will show a mind
equal to any elevation.</p>
<p>II.ii.131 (345,1)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">rewards</p>

<p>To spend his time, to end it]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I know not whether my conceit will be approved, but I cannot
forbear to think that our author wrote thus.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;he <i>rewards</i></p>
<p><i>His deeds with doing them, and is content</i></p>
<p><i>To spend his time, to spend it.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>To do great acts, for the sake of doing them; to spend his life,
for the sake of spending it.</p>
<p>II.iii.4 (348,2) We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is
a power that we have no power to do] [Warburton saw this as "a
ridicule on the Augustine manner of defining <i>free-will</i>."] A
ridicule may be intended, but the sense is clear enough.
<i>Power</i> first signifies <i>natural power</i> or <i>force</i>,
and then <i>moral power</i> or <i>right</i>. Davies has used the
same word with great variety of meaning.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Use all thy</i> powers <i>that heavenly</i> power <i>to

<p><i>That gave thee</i> power <i>to do</i>.&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>II.iii.18 (348,3) many-headed multitude] Hanmer reads,
<i>many-headed</i> monster, but without necessity. To be
<i>many-headed</i> includes <i>monstrousness</i>.</p>
<p>II.iii.115 (352,7) I will not seal your knowledge] I will not
strengthen or compleat your knowledge. The seal is that which gives
authenticity to a writing.</p>
<p>II.iii.122 (352,8)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">

<p>Why stand I here in this ragged apparel to beg of Bob and Dick,
and such others as <i>make their appearance</i> here, their
<i>unnecessary votes</i>. I rather think we should read [instead of
<i>voucher</i>], <i>Their needless</i> vouches. But <i>voucher</i>
may serve, as it may perhaps signify either the act or the
agent.</p>
<p>II.iii.122 (352) this woolvish gown] Signifies this <i>rough
hirsute</i> gown.</p>
<p>II.iii.182 (355,1) ignorant to see't?] [W: "ignorant" means
"impotent"] That <i>ignorant</i> at any time has, otherwise than
consequentially, the same meaning with <i>impotent</i>, I do not
know. It has no such meaning in this place. <i>Were you</i>
ignorant <i>to see it</i>, is, did you want knowledge to discern
it.</p>
<p>II.iii.208 (356,2) free contempt] That is, with contempt open
and unrestrained.</p>
<p>II.iii.227 (357,4) Enforce his pride] Object his pride, and
enforce the objection.</p>
<p>II.iii.258 (358,7) Scaling his present bearing with his past]
That is, <i>weighing</i> his past and present behaviour.</p>

<p>III.i.89 (363,6) minnows] a <i>minnow</i> is one of the smallest
river fish, called in some counties a <i>pink</i>.</p>

established role; it was a form of speech to which he has no
right.</p>

</div>
<p>I neither think the transposition of one editor right, nor the

suits the speaker's purpose.</p>
<p>III.i.151 (367,7) That love the fundamental part of state/More

The meaning is, You whose zeal predominates over your terrours; you
who do not so much fear the danger of violent measures, as wish the
good to which they are necessary, the preservation of the original
constitution of our government.</p>
<p>III.i.158 (368,2) Mangles true judgment] <i>Judgment</i> is
<i>judgment</i> in its common sense, or the faculty by which right
is distinguished from wrong.</p>
<p>III.i.159 (368,3) that integrity which should become it]
<i>Integrity</i> is in this place <i>soundness</i>, uniformity,
consistency, in the same sense as Dr. Warburton often uses it, when
he mentions the <i>integrity</i> of a metaphor. To <i>become</i>,
is to <i>suit</i>, to <i>befit</i>.</p>

<p>III.i.242 (371,7) One time will owe another] I know not whether

in which the people are seditious, will <i>give us power</i> in
some other time; or, <i>this time</i> of the people's predominance
will <i>run them in debt</i>; that is, will lay them open to the
law, and expose them hereafter to more servile subjection.</p>

ingenious, yet I think it not right. <i>Head</i> or <i>hand</i> is
indifferent. The <i>hand</i> is <i>waved</i> to gain attention; the
<i>head</i> is shaken in token of sorrow. The word <i>wave</i>
suits better to the hand, but in considering the authour's
language, too much stress must not be laid on propriety against the
copies. I would read thus,</p>

<p>It is remarkable, that, among the political maxims of the
speculative Harrington, there is one which he might have borrowed
from this speech. <i>The people</i>, says he, <i>cannot see, but
they can feel</i>. It is not much to the honour of the people, that
they have the same character of stupidity from their enemy and
their friend. Such was the power of our authour's mind, that he
looked through life in all its relations private and civil.</p>
<p>IV.i.7 (390,1) Fortune's blows,/When most struck home, being
gentle wounded, craves/A noble cunning] This it the ancient and
authentick reading. The modern editors have, for <i>gentle
wounded</i>, silently substituted <i>gently warded</i>, and Dr.
Warburton has explained <i>gently</i> by <i>nobly</i>. It is good
to be sure of our authour's words before we go about to explain
their meaning.</p>
<p>The sense is, When Fortune strikes her hardest blows, to be
wounded, and yet continue calm, requires a generous policy. He
calls this calmness <i>cunning</i>, because it is the effect of
reflection and philosophy. Perhaps the first emotions of nature are
nearly uniform, and one man differs from another in the power of
endurance, as he is better regulated by precept and
instruction.</p>

<p>The word <i>mankind</i> is used maliciously by the first

is a woman with the roughness of a man, and, in an aggravated
sense, a woman ferocious, violent, and eager to shed blood. In this
sense Sicinius asks Volumnia, if she be <i>mankind</i>. She takes
<i>mankind</i> for a <i>human creature</i>, and accordingly cries

</div>
</div>
<p>He who reads this [My country have I and my lovers left;/This
enemy's town I'll enter] would think that he was reading the lines
of Shakespeare: except that Coriolanus, being already in the town,
says, he <i>will enter it</i>. Yet the old edition exhibits it

his former observation, he says, that <i>he has</i> lost <i>his

house of Anfidius, <i>I'll enter if he slay me</i>.</p>
<p>I have preferred the common reading, because it is, though
faulty, yet intelligible, and the original passage, for want of
copies, cannot be restored.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The meaning, somewhat harshly expressed, according to our
authour's custom, is this: <i>We need not fear him</i>, the proper
<i>remedies</i> against him <i>are taken</i>, by restoring <i>peace
and quietness</i>.</p>
<p>IV.vi.32 (410,2) affecting one sole throne,/Without assistance]
That is, without <i>assessors</i>; without any other suffrage.</p>

<p>IV.vi.72 (412,4) can no more atone] To <i>atone</i>, in the
active sense, is to <i>reconcile</i>, and is so used by our

<p>Ausidius assigns three probable reasons of the miscarriage of
Coriolanus; pride, which easily follows an uninterrupted train of

<p>Here is, I think, a chasm. The speaker's purpose seems to be
this: <i>To yield to his conditions</i> is ruin, and better cannot

<p>[W: narrified] [Hanmer: magnified] If the commentator had given
any example of the word <i>narrify</i>, the correction would have
been not only received, but applauded. Now, since the new word
stands without authority, we must try what sense the old one will
afford. To <i>verify</i> is <i>to establish by testimony</i>. One
may say with propriety, he brought false witnesses to verify his
title. Shakespeare considered the word with his usual laxity, as
importing rather <i>testimony</i> than <i>truth</i>, and only meant
to say, <i>I</i> bore witness <i>to my friends with all the size

Warburton also quotes <i>Tarquin and Lucrece</i>, "To dry the old
oak's sap, and cherish springs" and emends to "tarnish," from the
French, meaning "to dry up," used of springs and rivers.] I have
inserted this note, because it contains an apology for many others.
It is not denied that many French words were mingled in the time of
Elizabeth with our language, which have since been ejected, and
that any which are known to have been then in use may be properly
recalled when they will help the sense. But when a word is to be
admitted, the first question should be, by whom was it ever
received? in what book can it be shown? If it cannot be proved to
have been in use, the reasons which can justify its reception must
be stronger than any critick will often have to bring. Even in this
certain emendation, the new word is very liable to contest. I
should read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>and</i> perish <i>springs</i>.</p>

if it had been written for him; but it may, without impropriety, be

should we dispossess him?</p>
<p>V.iv.22 (439,1) He sits in state as a thing made for Alexander]
In a foregoing note he was said to <i>sit in gold</i>. The phrase,

<p>(447) General Observation. The tragedy of Coriolanus is one of
the most amusing of our author's performances. The old man's
merriment in Menenius; the lofty lady's dignity in Volumnia; the
bridal modesty in Virgilia; the patrician and military haughtiness
in Coriolanus; the plebeian malignity and tribunitian insolence in
Brutus and Sicinius, make a very pleasing and interesting variety:
and the various revolutions of the hero's fortune fill the mind
with anxious curiosity. There is, perhaps, too much bustle in the
first act, and too little in the last.</p>

Warburton has a long note on this occasion, which is very trifling.

should not humour me] The meaning, I think, is this, <i>Caesar
loves Brutus, but if Brutus and I were to change places, his love
should not humour me</i>, should not take hold of my affection, so
as to make me forget my principles.</p>
<p>I.iii.1 (18,5) brought you Caesar home?] Did you attend Caesar

<p>Perhaps, <i>Who</i> gaz'd <i>upon me</i>.</p>

<p>I.iii.65 (20,9) and children calculate] [Shakespeare, with his

<p>Between the acting of a dreadful thing,</p>

<p>Like a phantasma, or a hideous dream:</p>
<p>The genius, and the mortal instruments</p>
<p>Are then in council; and the state of man,</p>
<p>Like to a little kingdom, suffers then</p>
<p>The nature of an insurrection]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The [Greek: deinon] of the Greek critics does not, I think, mean
sentiments which <i>raise fear</i>, more than <i>wonder</i>, or any
other of the tumultuous passions; [Greek: to deinon] is that which
<i>strikes</i>, which <i>astonishes</i>, with the idea either of
some great subject, or of the author's abilities.</p>
<p>Dr. Warburton'a pompous criticism might well have been
shortened. The <i>genius</i> is not the <i>genius</i> of a
<i>kingdom</i>, nor are the <i>instruments, conspirators</i>.
Shakespeare is describing what passes in a single bosom, the
<i>insurrection</i> which a conspirator feels agitating the
<i>little kingdom</i> of his own mind; when the <i>Genius</i>, or
power that watches for his protection, and the <i>mortal
instruments</i>, the passions, which excite him to a deed of honour
and danger, are in council and debate; when the desire of action
and the care of safety, keep the mind in continual fluctuation and
disturbance.</p>
<p>II.i.76 (29,5) any mark of favour] Any distinction of

<p>II.i.114 (31,7) No, not an oath. If not the face of men] Dr.
Warburten would read <i>fate of men</i>; but his elaborate
emendation is, I think, erroneous. <i>The</i> face <i>of men</i> is
the <i>countenance</i>, the <i>regard</i>, the <i>esteem</i> of the
publick; in other terms, <i>honour</i> and <i>reputation</i>; or
<i>the face of men</i> may mean the dejected look of the
people.</p>

<p>II.ii.36 (42,3) death, a necessary end,/Will come, when it will

<p>II.ii.41 (42,4) The Gods do this in shame of cowardice:/Caesar
should be a beast without a heart] The ancients did not place
courage but wisdom in the heart.</p>
<p>II.ii.88 (44,7) and that great men shall press/For tinctures,
stains, relicks, and cognisance] [Warburton conjectured some lines
lost] I am not of opinion that any thing is lost, and have
therefore marked no omission. This speech, which is intentionally
pompous, is somewhat confused. There are two allusions; one to
coats armorial, to which princes make additions, or give new
<i>tinctures</i>, and new marks of <i>cognisance</i>; the other to
martyrs, whose reliques are preserved with veneration. The Romans,
says Brutus, all come to you as to a saint, for reliques, as to a
prince, for honours.</p>
<p>II.ii.104 (45,8) And reason to my love is liable] And reason, or

join with traitors in contriving thy destruction.</p>
<p>III.i.38 (51,2) And turn pre-ordinance and first decree/Into the
lane of children] I do not veil understand what is meant by the
<i>lane</i> of children. I should read, the <i>law</i> of children.
It was, <i>change pre-ordinance and decree into the law of
children</i>; into such slight determinations as every start of
will would alter. <i>Lane</i> and <i>laws</i> in some manuscripts
are not easily distinguished.</p>
<p>III.i.67 (52,4) apprehensive] Susceptible of fear, or other

and To <i>hold on</i> a <i>course</i> or <i>way</i>.</p>
<p>III.i.75 (52,7) Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?] I would read,

<p>In a tract intitled, <i>The Office of the Conestable &amp;

<p>III.ii.116 (66,8) Caesar has had great wrong] [Pope has a rather
ridiculous note on this] I have inserted this note, because it is
Pope's, for it is otherwise of no value. It is strange that he
should so much forget the date of the copy before him, as to think
it not printed in Jonson's time. (see 1765, VII, 81, 1)</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>[W: own charge] The arguments for the change proposed are
insufficient. Brutus could not but know whether the wrongs
committed were done by those who were immediately under the command
of Cassius, or those under his officers. The answer of Brutus to
the servant is only an act of artful civility; his question to
Lucilius proves, that his suspicion still continued. Yet I cannot
but suspect a corruption, and would read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>In his own change, or by ill</i> offices.</p>

<p>That is, either <i>changing</i> his inclination <i>of

<p>The meaning is this; I do not look for your faults, I only see

</div>
</div>
<p>[W: thou needst a Roman's,] I am not satisfied with the change
proposed, yet cannot deny, that the words, as they now stand,
require some interpretation. I think he means only, that he is so
far from Avarice, when the cause of his country requires
liberality, that if any man should wish for his heart, he would not
need enforce his desire any otherwise, than by showing that he was
a Roman.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Dr. Warburton thinks, that in this speech something is lost, but
there needed only a parenthesis to clear it. The construction is
this; I an determined to act according to that philosophy which
directed me to blame the suicide of Cato, arming myself with
patience.</p>
<p>V.iv.12 (102,6) <i>Luc.</i> Only I yield to die:/There is so
much, that then wilt kill me straight] Dr. Warburton has been much
inclined to find <i>lacunae</i>, or passages broken by omission,
throughout this play. I think he has been always mistaken. The
soldier here says, <i>Yield, or thou diest</i>. Lucilius replies, I
yield only on this condition, that I may die; here is so much gold
as thou seest in my hand, which I offer thee as a reward for speedy
death. What now is there wanting?</p>
<p>(106) General Observation. Of this tragedy many particular
passages deserve regard, and the contention and reconcilement of
Brutus and Cassius is universally celebrated; but I have never been
strongly agitated in perusing it, and think it somewhat cold and
unaffecting, compared with some other of Shakespeare's plays; his
adherence to the real story, and to Roman manners, seems to have
impeded the natural vigour of his genius.</p>
<h2>ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA</h2>
<p>I.i.9 (110,2) And is become the bellows, and the fan,/To cool a
gypsy's lust] In this passage something seems to be wanting. The
bellows and fan being commonly used for contrary purposes, were
probably opposed by the author, who might perhaps have written,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>&mdash;is become the bellows, and the fan</i>,</p>
<p>To kindle and <i>to cool a gypsy's lust</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I.i.10 (110,3) gypsy's lust] Gypsy is here used both in the
original meaning for an <i>Egyptian</i>, and in its accidental
sense for a <i>bad woman</i>.</p>
<p>1.i.17 (110,6) Then must thou needs find out new heaven] Thou
must set the boundary of my love at a greater distance than the
present visible universe affords.</p>

few words.</p>
<p>I.i.33 (111,8) and the wide arch/Of the rang'd empire fall!]
[Taken from the Roman custom of raising triumphal arches to
perpetuate their victories. Extremely noble. WARBURTON.] I am in
doubt whether Shakespeare had any idea but of a fabrick standing on
pillars. The later editions have all printed the <i>raised</i>
empire, for the <i>ranged</i> empire, as it was first given, (see
1765, VII, 107, 8)</p>

<p>I.ii.5 (113,2) change his horns with garlands] [W: charge] Sir
Thomas Hanmer reads, not improbably, <i>change</i> for <i>horns</i>
his <i>garlands</i>. I am in doubt, whether to <i>change</i> is not
merely to <i>dress</i>, or <i>to dress with changes of</i>
garlands.</p>
<p>I.ii.23 (114,3) I had rather heat my liver] To know why the lady
is so averse from <i>heating</i> her <i>liver</i>, it must be

<p>I.ii.35 (114,5) Then, belike, my children shall have no names]
If I have already had the best of my fortune, then I suppose <i>I

every wish, a million] [W: fertil ev'ry] For <i>foretel</i>, in
ancient editions, the latter copies have <i>foretold</i>.
<i>Foretel</i> favours the emendation, which is made with great
acuteness; yet the original reading may, I think, stand. <i>If you
had as many wombs as you will have wishes; and</i> I should
<i>foretel all those wishes, I should foretel a million of
children.</i> It is an ellipsis very frequent in conversation; <i>I
should shame you, and tell all</i>; that is, <i>and if I should</i>
tell all. <i>And</i> is for <i>and if</i>, which was anciently, and
is still provincially, used for <i>if</i>.</p>
<p>I.ii.105 (117,8) extended Asia] To <i>extend</i>, is a term used
for to <i>seize</i>; I know not whether that be not the sense
here.</p>
<p>I.ii.113 (118,9) Oh, when we bring forth weeds,/When our quick

than good.</p>

the <i>east</i>, and <i>by revolution lowering</i>, or setting in

is an obscure passage. The explanation which Dr. Warburton has
offered is such, that I can add nothing to it; yet perhaps
Shakespeare, who was less learned than his commentator, meant only,
that our pleasures, as they are <i>revolved</i> in the mind, turn
to pain.</p>

reads, They shew <i>to man the tailors of the earth comforting</i>
him therein. I think the passage, with somewhat less alteration,
for alteration is always dangerous, may stand thus; <i>It shews

<p>If this reading stand, I think the explanation of Hanmer must be
received, (see 1765, VII, 122, 6)</p>
<p>I.iv.3 (127,9) One great competitor] Perhaps, <i>Our</i> great
competitor.</p>
<p>I.iv.12 (128,1) as the spots of heaven,/More fiery by night's
blackness] If by spots are meant stars, as night has no other fiery
spots, the comparison is forced and harsh, stars having been always
supposed to beautify the night; nor do I comprehend what there is
in the counter-part of this simile, which answers to night's
blackness. Hanmer reads,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>spots</i> on ermine</p>
<p>Or fires, <i>by night's blackness</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I.iv.14 (128,2) purchas'd] Procured by his own fault or
endeavour.</p>
<p>I.iv.21 (128,3) say, this becomes him, (As his composure must be
rare, indeed, Whom these things cannot blemish] This seems
inconsequent. I read</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>And his composure</i>, &amp;c.</p>
<p><i>Grant that this becomes him</i>, and <i>if it can become him,
he must</i></p>
<p><i>have in him something very uncommon</i>; yet,
<i>&amp;c.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I.iv.25 (128,4) So great weight in his lightness] The word
<i>light</i> it one of Shakespeare's favourite play-things. The
sense is, His trifling levity throws so much burden upon us.</p>
<p>I.iv.25 (129,5)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>If he fill'd</p>
<p>His vacancy with his voluptuousness,</p>
<p>Full surfeits, and the dryness of his bones,</p>
<p>Call on him for't]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>Call on him</i>, is, <i>visit him</i>. Says Caesar, <i>If
Antony followed his debaucheries at a time of leisure, I should
leave him to be punished by their natural consequences, by</i>
surfeits <i>and</i> dry bones.</p>
<p>I.iv.31 (129,6) boys; who being mature in knowledge] For this
Hanmer, who thought the <i>maturity</i> of a <i>boy</i> an
inconsistent idea, has put,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>who</i>, immature <i>in knowledge</i>,</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>but the words <i>experience</i> and <i>judgment</i> require that
we read <i>mature</i>; though Dr. Warburton has received the
emendation. By <i>boys mature in knowledge</i>, are meant, <i>boys
old enough to know their duty</i>.</p>
<p>I.iv.38 (129,7) he is belov'd of these/That only have fear'd
Caesar] Those whom not <i>love</i> but <i>fear</i> made adherents
to Caesar, now shew their affection for Pompey.</p>
<p>I.iv.49 (130,2) which they ear] To <i>ear</i>, is to
<i>plow</i>; a common metaphor.</p>
<p>I.iv.52 (130,3) Lack blood to think on't] Turn pale at the
thought of it.</p>
<p>I.v.4 (132,5) mandragora] A plant of which the infusion was
supposed to procure sleep. Shakespeare mentions it in
<i>Othello</i>:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Not poppy, nor</i> mandragora,</p>
<p><i>Can ever med'cine thee to that sweet sleep</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I.v.38 (133,8) that great medicine hath/With his tinct gilded
thee] Alluding to the philosopher's stone, which, by its touch,
converts base metal into gold. The alchemists call the matter,
whatever it be, by which they perform transmutation, a
<i>medicine</i>.</p>
<p>I.v.48 (134,9) arm-gaunt steed] [i.e. his steed worn lean and
thin by much service in war. So Fairfax, <i>His</i> stall-worn
<i>steed the champion stout bestrode</i>. WARB.] On this note Mr.
Edwards has been very lavish of his pleasantry, and indeed has
justly censured the misquotation of <i>stall-worn</i>, for
<i>stall-worth</i>, which means <i>strong</i>, but makes no attempt
to explain the word in the play. Mr. Seyward, in his preface to
Beaumont, has very elaborately endeavoured to prove, that an
<i>arm-gaunt</i> steed is a steed with <i>lean shoulders</i>.
<i>Arm</i> is the Teutonick word for <i>want</i>, or
<i>poverty</i>. <i>Arm-gaunt</i> may be therefore an old word,
signifying, <i>lean</i> for <i>want</i>, ill fed. Edwards's
observation, that a worn-out horse is not proper for Atlas to mount
in battle, is impertinent; the horse here mentioned seems to be a
post horse, rather than a war horse. Yet as <i>arm-gaunt</i> seems
not intended to imply any defect, it perhaps means, a horse so
slender that a man might clasp him, and therefore formed for
expedition. Hanmer reads,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>arm-girt steed</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I.v.50 (134,1) Was beastly dumb by him] Mr. Theobald reads
<i>dumb'd</i>, put to silence. <i>Alexas means</i>, (says he)
<i>the horse made such a neighing, that if he had spoke he could
not have been heard</i>.</p>
<p>I.v.76 (136,3) Get me ink and paper: he shall have every day/ A
several greeting, or I'll unpeople Aegypt] By sending out
messengers.</p>
<p>II.i (136,4) <i>Enter Pompey</i>, <i>Menecrates</i>, <i>and
Menas</i>] The persons are so named in the first edition; but I
know not why Menecrates appears; Menas can do all without him.</p>
<p>II.i.4 (136,5) While we are suitors to their throne, decays/The
thing we sue for] [W: delays] It is not always prudent to be too
hasty in exclamation; the reading which Dr. Warburton rejects as
<i>nonsense</i>, is in my opinion right; if <i>delay</i> be what
they sue for, they have it, and the consolation offered becomes
superfluous. The meaning is, <i>While we are praying</i>, <i>the
thing for which we pray</i> is losing its value.</p>
<p>II.i.38 (138,8) The ne'er-lust-wearied Antony] [Theobald emended
"near lust-wearied" to "ne'er-lust-wearied"] Could it be imagined,
after this swelling exultation, that the first edition stands
literally thus,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>The</i> neere <i>lust wearied Antony</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>II.i.45 (139,9) square] That is, quarrel.</p>
<p>II.i.51 (139,1) Our lives upon] This play is not divided into
acts by the authour or first editors, and therefore the present
division may be altered at pleasure. I think the first act may be
commodiously continued to this place, and the second act opened
with the interview of the chief persons, and a change of the state
of action. Yet it must be confessed, that it is of small
importance, where these unconnected and desultory scenes are
interrupted.</p>
<p>II.ii.7 (140,2) Were I the wearer of Antonius' beard,/I would
not shav't to-day] I believe he means, <i>I would meet him
undressed</i>, <i>without shew of respect</i>.</p>
<p>II.ii.25 (141,3) Nor curstness grow to the matter] Let not
<i>ill-humour</i> be added to the real <i>subject</i> of our
difference.</p>
<p>II.ii.28 (141,4) <i>Caes</i>. Sit./<i>Ant</i>. Sit, sir!]
[Antony appears to be jealous of a circumstance which seemed to
indicate a consciousness of superiority in his too successful
partner in power; and accordingly resents the invitation of Caesar
to be seated: Caesar answers, <i>Nay then</i>&mdash;i.e. <i>if you
are so ready to resent what I meant an act of civility, there can
be no reason to suppose you have temper enough for the business on
which at present we are met</i>. STEEVENS.] The following
circumstance may serve to strengthen Mr. Steevens's opinion: When
the fictitious Sebastian made his appearance in Europe, he came to
a conference with the Conde de Lemos; to whom, after the firat
exchange of civilities, he said, <i>Conde de Lemos, be covered</i>.
And being asked by that nobleman, by what pretences he laid claim
to the superiority expressed by such permission, he replied, I do
it by right of my birth; I am Sebastian. (1773)</p>
<p>II.ii.43 (142,5) their contestation/Was theam for you, you were
the word of war] [W: theam'd] I am neither satisfied with the
reading nor the emendation; <i>theam'd</i> is, I think, a word
unauthorised, and very harsh. Perhaps we may read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>their contestation</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Had <i>theme</i> from <i>you</i>, <i>you were the word o' th'
war</i>. <i>The dispute derived its subject from you</i>. It may be
corrected by mere transposition,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>their contestation</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>You were theme for, <i>you were the word</i>.</p>
<p>II.ii.51 (143,8) Having alike your cause?] The meaning seems to
be, <i>having the same cause as you to be offended with me</i>. But
why, because he was offended with Antony, should he make war upon
Caesar? May it not be read thus,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>Did he not rather</i></p>
<p><i>Discredit my authority with yours,</i></p>
<p><i>And make the wars alike against my stomach</i>,</p>
<p>Hating <i>alike</i> our <i>cause</i>?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>II.ii.53 (143,9) As matter whole you have not to make it with]
The original copy reads,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>As matter whole you</i> have <i>to make it with</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Without doubt erroneously; I therefore only observe it, that the
reader may more readily admit the liberties which the editors of
this authour's works have necessarily taken.</p>
<p>II.ii.61 (144,1) fronted] i.e. <i>opposed</i>.</p>
<p>II.ii.85 (145,4) The honour's sacred which he talks on
now,/Supposing that I lack'd it] [<i>Sacred</i>, for unbroken,
unviolated. WARB.] Dr. Warburton seems to understand this passage
thus; <i>The honour which he</i> talks <i>of me as</i> lacking,
<i>is</i> unviolated, <i>I never lacked it</i>. This may perhaps be
the true meaning, but before I read the note, I understood it thus:
Lepidus interrupts Caesar, on the supposition that what he is about
to say will be too harsh to be endured by Antony; to which Antony
replies, <i>No, Lepidus, let him speak, the security of</i> honour
on which he now speaks, <i>on which this conference is held
now</i>, is sacred, <i>even</i> supposing that I lacked
<i>honour</i> before.</p>
<p>II.ii.112 (146,5) your considerate stone] This line is passed by
all the editors, as if they understood it, and believed it
universally, intelligible. I cannot find in it any very obvious,
and hardly any possible meaning. I would therefore read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Go to then</i>, you <i>considerate</i> ones.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>You, who dislike my frankness and temerity of speech, and are so
<i>considerate</i> and discreet, <i>go to</i>, do your on
business.</p>
<p>II.ii.113 (146,6) I do not much dislike the matter, but/The
manner of his speech] I do not, says Caesar, think the man wrong,
but too free of him interposition; <i>for't cannot be, we shall
remain in friendship: yet if it were possible, I would endeavour
it</i>.</p>
<p>II.ii.123 (147,7) your reproof/Were well deserv'd] In the old
edition,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>your</i> proof</p>
<p><i>Were well deserv'd</i>&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Which Mr. Theobald, with his usual triumph, changes to
<i>approof</i>, which he explains, <i>allowance</i>. Dr. Warburton
inserted <i>reproof</i> very properly into Hanmer's edition, but
forgot it in his own.</p>
<p>II.ii.159 (148,8) Lest my remembrance suffer ill report] Lest I
be thought too willing to forget benefits, I must barely return him
thanks, and then I will defy him.</p>
<p>II.ii.210 (150,1) And what they undid, did] It might be read
less harshly,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>And what they did</i>, undid.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>II.ii.212 (150,2) tended her i' the eyes] Perhaps <i>tended
her</i> by th' <i>eyes</i>, discovered her will by her eyes.</p>
<p>II.iii.21 (153,6) thy angel/Becomes a Fear] Mr.Uptan reads,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Becomes</i> afear'd,&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The common reading is more poetical.</p>
<p>II.iii.37 (154,7) his quails ever/Beat mine] The ancients used
to match quails as we match cocks.</p>
<p>II.iii.38 (154,8) inhoop'd, at odds] Thus the old copy.
<i>Inhoop'd</i> is <i>inclosed, confined</i>, that they may fight.
The modern editions read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Beat mine</i>, in whoop'd-<i>at odds</i>.&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>II.v.1 (155,9) musick, moody food] [The <i>mood</i> is the
<i>mind</i>, or <i>mental disposition</i>. Van Haaren's panegyrick
on the English begins, <i>Groot-moedig Volk, great-minded
nation</i>.] Perhaps here is a poor jest intended between
<i>mood</i> the <i>mind</i> and <i>moods</i> of musick.</p>
<p>II.v.41 (l57,4) Not like a formal man] [<i>Formal</i>, for
ordinary. WARB.] Rather decent, regular.</p>
<p>II.v.103 (161,8) Thou art not what thou'rt sure of!] For this,
which is not easily understood, Sir Thomas Hanmer has given,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>That</i> say'st but <i>what thou'rt sure of!</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I am not satisfied with the change, which, though it affords
sense, exhibits little spirit. I fancy the line consists only of
abrupt starts.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Oh that his fault should make a knave of thee</i>,</p>
<p>That art&mdash;not what?&mdash;Thou'rt sure on't.&mdash;Get
thee</p>
<p>hence.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>That his fault should make a knave of thee that
art</i>&mdash;but what <i>shall I say thou art not</i>? Thou art
then sure of <i>this marriage.</i>&mdash;Get thee hence.</p>
<p>Dr. Warburton has received Sir T. Hanmer's emendation.</p>
<p>II.v.115 (161,9) Let him for ever go] She is now talking in
broken sentences, not of the messenger, but Antony.</p>
<p>II.vi.24 (163,2) Thou canst not fear us] Thou canst not affright
us with thy numerous navy.</p>
<p>II.vi.28 (163,3) But since the cuckow builds not for himself]
Since, like the cuckow, that seizes the nests of other birds, you
have invaded a house which you could not build, keep it while you
can.</p>
<p>II.vii.1 (167,6) some o' their plants] <i>Plants</i>, besides
its common meaning, is here used for the <i>foot</i>, from the
Latin.</p>
<p>II.vii.14 (167,9) a partizan] A pike.</p>
<p>II.vii.16 (167,1) To be call'd into a huge sphere, and not to be
seen to move in't, are the holes where eyes should be, which
pitifully disaster the cheeks] This speech seems to be mutilated;
to supply the deficiencies is impossible, but perhaps the sense was
originally approaching to this.</p>
<p><i>To be called into a huge sphere, and not to be seen to move
in it</i>, is a very ignominious state; great offices <i>are the
holes where eyes should be, which</i>, if eyes be wanting,
<i>pitifully disaster the cheeks</i>.</p>
<p>II.vii.88 (170,2) thy pall'd fortunes] <i>Palled</i>, is vapid,
past its time of excellence; <i>palled</i> wine, is wine that has
lost its original spriteliness.</p>
<p>II.vii.102 (171,3) Strike the vessels] Try whether the casks
sound as empty.</p>
<p>II.vii.116 (171,4) The holding every man shall bear] Every man
shall accompany the chorus by drumming on his sides, in token of
concurrence and applause. [Theobald had emended "beat" to "bear"]
(1773)</p>
<p>III.i.1 (173,6) Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck]
<i>Struck</i> alludes to darting. Thou whose darts have so often
struck others, art struck now thyself. (1773)</p>
<p>III.ii.12 (175,8) Arabian bird!] The phoenix.</p>
<p>III.ii.16 (176,9)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Ho! hearts, tongues, figure, scribes, bards, poets, cannot</p>
<p>Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number, ho!]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Not only the tautology of <i>bards</i> and <i>poets</i>, but the
want of a correspondent action for the <i>poet</i>, whose business
in the next line is only to <i>number</i>, makes me suspect some
fault in this passage, which I know not how to mend.</p>
<p>III.ii.26 (176,1) as my furthest bond] As I will venture the
greatest pledge of security, on the trial of thy conduct.</p>
<p>III.ii.40 (177,1) The elements be kind to thee, and make/Thy
spirits all of comfort!] This is obscure. It seems to mean, <i>May
the different</i> elements <i>of the body, or principles of life,
maintain such proportion and harmony as may keep you
cheerful</i>.</p>
<p>III.iv.26 (182,7) I'll raise the preparation of a war/Shall
stain your brother] [T: strain] I do not see but <i>stain</i> may
be allowed to remain unaltered, meaning no more than <i>shame</i>
or <i>disgrace</i>.</p>
<p>III.iv.30 (182,8) Wars 'twixt you 'twain would be/As if the
world should cleave] The sense is, that war between Caesar and
Antony would engage the world between them, and that the slaughter
would be great in so extensive a commotion.</p>
<p>III.v.8 (183,9) rivality] Equal rank.</p>
<p>III.v.11 (183,1) Upon his own appeal] To <i>appeal</i>, in
Shakespeare, is to <i>accuse</i>; Caesar seized Lepidus without any
other proof than Caesar's accusation.</p>
<p>III.v.21 (184,3) More, Domitius] I have something <i>more</i> to
tell you, which I might have told at first, and delayed my news.
Antony requires your presence.</p>
<p>III.vi.9 (184,4) made her/Of Lower Syria, Cyprus,
Lydia./Absolute queen] For <i>Lydia</i>, Mr. Upton, from Plutarch,
has restored <i>Lybia</i>.</p>
<p>III.vi.68-75 (187,6) Mr. Upton remarks, that there are some
errours in this enumeration of the auxiliary kings; but it is
probable that the authour did not much wish to be accurate.</p>
<p>III.vi.95 (188,7) And gives his potent regiment to a trull]
<i>Regiment</i>, is <i>government, authority</i>; he puts his
<i>power</i> and his empire into the hands of a false woman.</p>
<p>It may be observed, that <i>trull</i> was not, in our author's
time, a term of mere infamy, but a word of slight contempt, as
<i>wench</i> is now.</p>
<p>III.vii.3 (188,8) forespoke my being] To <i>forespeak</i>, is to
<i>contradict</i>, to <i>speak against</i>, as <i>forbid</i> is to
order negatively.</p>
<p>III.vii.68 (191,1)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>By Hercules, I think, I am i' the right.</p>
<p>Can. Soldier, thou art: but his whole action grows</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>That is, his whole conduct becomes, ungoverned by the right, or
by reason.</p>
<p>III.vii.77 (191,2) distractions] Detachments; separate
bodies.</p>
<p>III.x.6 (193,4) The greater cantle] [A piece or lump. POPE.]
<i>Cantle</i> is rather a <i>corner</i>. Caesar in this play
mentions the <i>three-nook'd world</i>. Of this triangular world
every triumvir had a corner. (see 1765, VII, 185, 6)</p>
<p>III.x.9 (193,5) token'd pestilence] Spotted.</p>
<p>III.x.10 (193,6) Yon' ribauld nag of Aegypt] The word is in the
old edition <i>ribaudred</i>, which I do not understand, but
mention it, in hopes others may raise some happy conjecture.
[Tyrwhitt: hag] The brieze, or oestrum, the fly that stings cattle,
proves that <i>nag</i> is the right word. (1773)</p>
<p>III.x.11 (193,7) Whom leprosy o'ertake!] <i>Leprosy</i>, an
epidemical distemper of the Aegyptians; to which Horace probably
alludes in the controverted line.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Contaminato cum grege turpium</i></p>
<p><i>Morbo virorum.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>III.x.36 (195,1) The wounded chance of Antony] I know not
whether the author, who loves to draw his images from the sports of
the field, might not have written,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>The wounded</i> chase <i>of Antony</i>,&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The allusion is to a deer wounded and chased, whom all other
deer avoid. <i>I will</i>, says Enobarbus, <i>follow Antony</i>,
though <i>chased</i> and <i>wounded</i>.</p>
<p>The common reading, however, may very well stand.</p>
<p>III.xi.3 (195,2) so lated in the world] Alluding to a benighted
traveller.</p>
<p>III.xi.23 (196,3) I have lost command] I am not master of my own
emotions.</p>
<p>III.xi.35 (196,4) He at Philippi kept/His sword e'en like a
dancer] In the Moriaco, and perhaps anciently in the Pyrrhick
dance, the dancers held swords in their hands with the points
upward.</p>
<p>III.xi.39 (196,6) he alone/Dealt on lieutenantry] I know not
whether the meaning is, that Caesar acted only as lieutenant at
Philippi, or that he made his attempts only on lieutenants, and
left the generals to Antony.</p>
<p>III.xi.47 (197,7) death will seize her; but/Your comfort]
<i>But</i> has here, as once before in this play, the force of
<i>except</i>, or <i>unless</i>.</p>
<p>III.ii.52 (197,8) How I convey my shame] How, by looking another
way, I withdraw my ignominy from your sight.</p>
<p>III.ii.57 (197,9) ty'd by the strings] That is by the <i>heart
string</i>.</p>
<p>III.xii.18 (199,1) The circle of the Ptolemies] The diadem; the
ensign of royalty.</p>
<p>III.xii.34 (199,2) how Antony becomes his flaw] That is, how
Antony conforms himself to this breach of his fortune.</p>
<p>III.xiii.1 (200,3) Think, and die] [Hanmer: Drink] This reading,
offered by sir T. Hanmer, is received by Dr. Warburton and Mr.
Upton, but I have not advanced it into the page, not being
convinced that it is necessary. <i>Think, and die</i>; that is,
<i>Reflect on your folly, and leave the world</i>, is a natural
answer.</p>
<p>III.xiii.9 (201,4) he being/The meered question] The
<i>meered</i> question is a term I do not understand. I know not
what to offer, except,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>The</i> mooted <i>question</i>.&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>That is, the <i>disputed</i> point, the subject of debate.
<i>Mere</i> is indeed a <i>boundary</i>, and the <i>meered
question</i>, if it can mean any thing, may, with some violence of
language, mean, the <i>disputed boundary</i>.</p>
<p>III.xiii.25 (202, 5)</p>
<div class="poem">

</div>
</div>
<p>I require of Caesar not to depend on that superiority which the
<i>comparison</i> of our different fortunes may exhibit to him, but
to answer me man to man, in this decline of my age or power.</p>
<p>III.xiii.42 (202,6) The loyalty, well held to fools, does
make/Our faith meer folly] [T: Though loyalty, well held] I have
preserved the old reading: Enobarbus is deliberating upon
desertion, and finding it is more prudent to forsake a fool, and
more reputable to be faithful to him, makes no positive conclusion.
Sir T. Hanmer follows Theobald; Dr. Warburton retains the old
reading.</p>
<p>III.xiii.77 (204,9) Tell him, from his all-obeying breath I
hear/The doom of Aegypt] <i>Doom</i> is declared rather by an
<i>all-commanding</i>, than an <i>all-obeying breath</i>. I suppose
we ought to read,</p>

<p>III.xiii.81 (205,1) Give me grace] Grant me the favour.</p>
<p>III.xiii.109 (206,3) By one that looks on feeders?] One that
waits at the table while others are eating.</p>
<p>III.xiii.128 (207,4) The horned herd] It is not without pity and
indignation that the reader of this great poet meets so often with
this low jest, which is too much a favourite to be left out of
either mirth or fury.</p>
<p>III.xiii.151 (208,5) to quit me] To repay me this insult; to
<i>requite</i> me.</p>
<p>III.xiii.180 (209,9) Were nice and lucky] [<i>Nice</i>, for
delicate, courtly, flowing in peace. WARBURTON.] <i>Nice</i> rather
seems to be, <i>just fit for my purpose, agreeable to my wish</i>.
So we vulgarly say of any thing that is done better than was
expected, it is <i>nice</i>.</p>
<p>IV.i.5 (210,1) I have many other ways to die] [Upton: He
hath.../I laugh] I think this emendation deserves to be received.
It had, before Mr. Upton's book appeared, been made by sir T.
Hanmer.</p>
<p>IV.i.9 (211,2) Make boot of] Take advantage of.</p>
<p>IV.ii.8 (212,3) <i>take all</i>] Let the survivor take all. No
composition, victory or death.</p>
<p>IV.ii.14 (212,4) one of those odd tricks] I know not what
obscurity the editors find in this passage. <i>Trick</i> is here
used in the sense in which it is uttered every day by every mouth,
elegant and vulgar: yet sir T. Hanmer changes it to <i>freaks</i>,
and Dr. Warburton, in his rage of Gallicism, to <i>traits</i>.</p>
<p>IV.ii.26 (213,5) Haply, you shall not see me more; or if,/A
mangled shadow] <i>Or if</i> you see me more, you will see me <i>a

<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;mine <i>iron</i>&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>IV.iv.5 (215,9) Nay, I'll help too] These three little speeches,
which in the other editions are only one, and given to Cleopatra,
were happily disentangled by sir T. Hanmer.</p>
<p>IV.iv.10 (215,1) Briefly, sir] That is, <i>quickly</i>, sir.</p>
<p>IV.v.17 (218,3) Dispatch. Enobarbus!] Thus [<i>Dispatch, my
Eros</i>] the modern editors. The old edition reads,</p>
<div class="poem">

</div>
</div>
<p>Perhaps, it should be,</p>
<div class="poem">

<p>&mdash;<i>Dispatch! To Enobarbus!</i> (see 1765, VII, 208,
3)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>IV.vi.12 (219,6) persuade] The old copy has <i>dissuade</i>,
perhaps rightly.</p>
<p>IV.vi.34 (219,7) This blows my heart] All the latter editions
have,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>This</i> bows <i>my heart</i>;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I have given the original word again the place from which I
think it unjustly excluded. <i>This generosity</i>, (says
Enobarbus) swells <i>my heart</i>, so that it will quickly break,
<i>if thought break it not, a swifter mean</i>.</p>
<p>IV.vii.2 (220,8) and our oppression] Sir T. Hanmer has received
<i>opposition</i>. Perhaps rightly.</p>
<p>IV.viii.1 (221,9) run one before,/And let the queen know of our
guests] [W: gests] This passage needs neither correction nor
explanation. Antony after his success intends to bring his officers
to sup with Cleopatra, and orders notice to be given her of their
<i>guests</i>.</p>
<p>IV.viii.12 (222,1) To this great fairy] Mr. Upton has well
observed, that <i>fairy</i>; which Dr. Warburton and sir T. Hanmer
explain by <i>Inchantress</i>, comprises the idea of power and
beauty.</p>
<p>IV.viii.22 (222,2) get goal for goal of youth] At all plays of
barriers, the boundary is called a <i>goal</i>; to <i>win a
goal</i>, is to be superiour in a contest of activity.</p>
<p>IV.viii.31 (223,4) Bear our hack'd targets like the men that owe
them] i.e. hack'd as much as the men are to whom they belong.

</div>
<p>The pathetick of Shakespeare too often ends in the ridiculous.
It is painful to find the gloomy dignity of this noble scene
destroyed by the intrusion of a conceit so far-fetched and
unaffecting.</p>
<p>IV.xii.13 (226,1) Triple turn'd whore!] She was first for
Antony, then was supposed by him to have <i>turned</i> to Caesar,
when he found his messenger kissing her hand, then she
<i>turned</i> again to Antony, and now has <i>turned</i> to Caesar.
Shall I mention what has dropped into my imagination, that our
author might perhaps have written <i>triple-tongued</i>?
<i>Double-tongued</i> is a common term of reproach, which rage
might improve to <i>triple-tongued</i>. But the present reading may
stand.</p>
<p>IV.xii.21 (227,2) That pannell'd me at heels] All the editions
read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>That</i> pannell'd <i>me at heels</i>,&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Sir T. Hanmer substituted <i>spaniel'd</i> by an emendation,
with which it was reasonable to expect that even rival commentators
would be satisfied; yet Dr. Warburton proposes <i>pantler'd</i>, in
a note, of which he is not injur'd by the suppression; and Mr.
Upton having in his first edition proposed plausibly enough,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>That</i> paged <i>me at heels</i>,&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>in the second edition retracts his alteration, and maintains
<i>pannell'd</i> to be the right reading, being a metaphor taken,
he says, from a <i>pannel</i> of wainscot.</p>
<p>IV.xii.25 (227,3) this grave charm] I know not by what
authority, nor for what reason, <i>this</i> grave <i>charm</i>,
which the first, the only original copy exhibits, has been through
all the modern editors changed to <i>this</i> gay <i>charm</i>. By
<i>this</i> grave <i>charm</i>, is meant, <i>this sublime, this
majestic beauty</i>.</p>
<p>IV.xii.29 (227,4) to the very heart of loss] To the utmost loss
possible.</p>
<p>IV.xii.45 (228,7) Let me lodge, Lichas] Sir T. Hanmer reads
thus,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;thy <i>rage</i></p>
<p>Led thee <i>lodge Lichas</i>&mdash;and&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Subdue</i> thy <i>worthiest self</i>.&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This reading, harsh as it is, Dr. Warburton has received, after
having rejected many better. The meaning is, Let me do something in
my rage, becoming the successor of Hercules,</p>
<p>IV.xiv.19 (230,2) Pack'd cards with Caesar, and false play'd my
glory/Unto an enemy's triumph] [Warburton had explained and praised
Shakespeare's "metaphor"] This explanation is very just, the

<p>To <i>seel hawks</i>, is to close their eyes. The meaning will

vehicle of light, and then the earth will be dark.</p>
<p>IV.xv.19-23 (237,1) I here importune death] [Theobald had
regularized the versification and had added two words] Mr.
Theobald's emendation is received by the succeeding editors; but it
seems not necessary that a dialogue so distressful should be nicely
regular. I have therefore preserved the original reading in the
text, and the emendation below.</p>
<p>IV.xv.28 (238,2) still conclusion] Sedate determination; silent
coolness of resolution.</p>
<p>IV.xv.32 (236,3) Here's sport, indeed!] I suppose the meaning of
these strange words is, <i>here's</i> trifling, <i>you</i> do not
work <i>in earnest</i>.</p>
<p>IV.xv.39 (239,4) Quicken with kissing] That is, <i>Revive by my

This despicable line has occurred before.</p>
<p>IV.xv.65 (240,8) The soldier's pole] He at whom the soldiers

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Char</i>. Peace, peace, Iras.</p>
<p><i>Cleo</i>. No more&mdash;but e'en a woman]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>[W: peace, Isis] Of this note it may be truly said, that it at
least deserves to be right, nor can he, that shall question the
justness of the emendation, refuse his esteem to the ingenuity and
learning with which it is proposed.</p>
<p>Hanmer had proposed another emendation, not injudiciously. He
reads thus,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Iras. <i>Royal Aegypt! empress!</i></p>
<p>Cleo. <i>Peace, peace, Iras.</i></p>
<p><i>No more but a mere woman</i>, &amp;c.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>That is, <i>no more an empress, but a mere woman</i>.</p>
<p>It is somewhat unfortunate that the words, <i>mere woman</i>,
which so much strengthen the opposition to either <i>empress</i> or
<i>Isis</i>, are not in the original edition, which stands
thus,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>No more but</i> in a <i>woman</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>Mere woman</i> was probably the arbitrary reading of Rowe. I
suppose, however, that we muy justly change the ancient copy
thus,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>No more, but</i> e'en a <i>woman</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>which will enough accommodate either of the editors.</p>
<p>I am inclined to think that she speaks abruptly, not answering
her woman, but discoursing with her own thoughts,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>No more&mdash;but</i> e'en a <i>woman</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>I have</i> no more <i>of my wonted greatness</i>, but am even
a woman, <i>on the level with other women; were I what I once
was</i>.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;It were for me</p>
<p>To throw my scepter, <i>&amp;c</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>If this simple explanation be admitted, how much labour has been
thrown away. <i>Peace, peace, Iras</i>, is said by Charmian, when
she sees the queen recovering, and thinks speech troublesome.</p>
<p>V.i.15 (244,4) The round world/Should have shook lions into
civil streets] I think here is a line lost, after which it is in
vain to go in quest. The sense seems to have been this: <i>The
round world should have shook</i>, and this great alteration of the
system of things should send <i>lions into streets, and citizens
into dens</i>. There is sense still, but it is harsh and
violent.</p>
<p>V.i.27 (244,5) but it is tidings/To wash the eyes of kings!]
That is, May <i>the Gods rebuke me</i>, if this be not <i>tidings
to make kings weep</i>.</p>
<p><i>But</i>, again, for <i>if not</i>.</p>
<p>V.i.46 (245,7) that our stars,/Unreconciliable, should

that one of us must die.</p>
<p>V.i.52 (246,8) A poor Aegyptian yet; the queen my mistress] If
this punctuation be right, the man means to say, that he is <i>yet
an Aegyptian</i>, that is, <i>yet a servant of the queen of
Aegypt</i>, though soon to become, a subject of Rome.</p>
<p>V.i.65 (246,9) her life in Rome/Would be eternal in our triumph]
Hanmer reads judiciously enough, but without necessity,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Would be</i> eternalling <i>our triumph</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The sense is, <i>If she dies here, she will be forgotten, but if
I send her</i> in triumph at Rome, <i>her memory and my glory</i>
will be eternal.</p>
<p>V.ii.3 (247,1) fortune's knave] The <i>servant</i> of
fortune.</p>
<p>V.ii.4 (247,2)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">

<p>To do that thing, that ends all other deeds;</p>
<p>Which shackles accidents, and bolts up change;</p>
<p>Which sleeps, and never palates more the dung,</p>
<p>The beggar's nurse, and Caesar's]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>[Warburton added a whole line and emended "dung" to "dugg"] I
cannot perceive the loss of a line, or the need of an emendation.
The commentator seems to have entangled his own ideas; his
supposition that <i>suicide</i> is called <i>the beggar's nurse and
Caesar's</i>, and his concession that the position is
<i>intelligible</i>, show, I think, a mind not intent upon the
business before it. The difficulty of the passage, if any
difficulty there be, arises only from this, that the act of
suicide, and the state which is the effect of suicide are
confounded. Voluntary death, says she, is an act <i>which bolts up
change</i>; it produces a state,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Which sleeps, and never palates more the dung,</i></p>
<p><i>The beggar's nurse, and Caesar's</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Which has no longer need of the gross and terrene sustenance, in
the use of which Caesar and the beggar are on a level.</p>
<p>The speech is abrupt, but perturbation in such a state is surely
natural.</p>
<p>V.ii.29 (249,4) I am his fortune's vassal, and I send him/The
greatness he has got] I allow him to be my conqueror; I own his
superiority with complete submission.</p>
<p>V.ii.34 (249,5) You see how easily she may be surpriz'd] This
line in the first edition is given not to Charuian, but to
Proculeius; and to him it certainly belongs, though perhaps
misplaced. I would put it at the end of his foregoing speech,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Where he for grace is kneel'd to.</i></p>
<p>[Aside to Gallus.] <i>You see, how easily she may be
surpriz'd.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Then while Cleopatra makes a formal answer, Gallus, upon the
hint given, seizes her, and Proculeius, interrupting the civility
of his answer,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>&mdash;your plight is pity'd</i></p>
<p><i>Of him that caus'd it.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Cries out,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Guard her till, Caesar come.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>V.ii.40 (250,6) who are in this/Reliev'd, but not betray'd] [W:
Bereav'd, but] I do not think the emendation necessary, since the
sense is not made better by it, and the abruptness in Cleopatra's
answer is more forcible in the old reading.</p>
<p>V.ii.42 (250,7) rids our dogs of languish] For <i>languish</i>,
I think we may read, <i>anguish</i>.</p>
<p>V.ii.48 (251,8) Worth many babes and beggars] Why, death, wilt
thou not rather seize a queen, than employ thy force upon
<i>babes</i> and <i>beggars</i>. (see 1765, VII, 238, 9)</p>
<p>V.ii.50 (251,9) If idle talk will once be necessary] [This
nonsense should be reformed thus,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>If idle</i> TIME <i>whill once be necessary.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>i.e. if <i>repose</i> be necessary to cherish life, I will not
sleep. WARBURTON.] I do not see that the nonsense is made sense by
the change. Sir T. Hanmer reads,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>If idle talk will once be</i> accessary;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Neither is this better. I know not what to offer better than an
easy explanation. That is, <i>I will not eat</i>, and <i>if it will
be necessary now for once</i> to waste a moment in <i>idle talk</i>
of my purpose, <i>I will not sleep neither</i>. In common
conversation we often use <i>will be</i>, with as little relation
to futurity. As, Now I am going, it <i>will be</i> fit for me to
dine first.</p>
<p>V.ii.98 (254,2)</p>
<div class="poem">

</div>
</div>
<p>[W: Nature's prize] In this passage I cannot discover any
temptation to critical experiments. The word <i>piece</i>, is a
term appropriated to works of art. Here Nature and Fancy produce
each their <i>piece</i>, and the <i>piece</i> done by Nature had
the preference. Antony was in reality <i>past the size of
dreaming</i>; he was more by <i>Nature</i> than <i>Fancy</i> could
present in sleep.</p>
<p>V.ii.121 (255,3) I cannot project mine own cause so well] [W:
procter] Sir T. Hanmer reads,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>I cannot</i> parget <i>my own cause&mdash;-</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>meaning, I cannot <i>whitewash, varnish</i>, or <i>gloss</i> my
cause. I believe the present reading to be right. To <i>project a
cause</i> is to <i>represent</i> a cause; to <i>project</i> it
<i>well</i>, is to <i>plan</i> or <i>contrive</i> a scheme of
defense.</p>
<p>V.ii.139 (256,4) "tis exactly valued, /Not petty things
admitted] [T: omitted] Notwithstanding the wrath of Mr. Theobald, I
have restored the old reading. She is angry afterwards, that she is
accused of having reserved more than petty things. Dr. Warburton
and sir T. Hanmer follow Theobald.</p>
<p>V.ii.146 (257,5) seel my lips] Sew up my mouth.</p>
<p>V.ii.163 (258,7) Parcel the sum of my disgraces by] <i>To parcel
her disgraces</i>, might be expressed in vulgar language, <i>to

</div>
</div>
<p>I do not think that either of the criticks [Warburton and
Hanmer] have reached the sense of the author, which may be very
commodiously explained thus;</p>
<p>We suffer at our highest state of elevation in the <i>thoughts

that contented themselves only to think ill before, call us to

<p>If any alteration be necessary, I should only propose, <i>Be 't

<p>V.ii.226 (261,5) Their most absurd intents] [T: assured] I have
preserved the old reading. The design certainly appeared
<i>absurd</i> enough to Cleopatra, both as she thought it
unreasonable in itself, and as she knew it would fail.</p>
<p>V.ii.243 (263,7) the pretty worm of Nilus] <i>Worm</i> is the
Teutonick word for <i>serpent</i>; we have the <i>blind-worm</i>
and <i>slow-worm</i> still in our language, and the Norwegians call
an enormous monster, seen sometimes in the northern ocean, the
<i>sea-worm</i>.</p>
<p>V.ii.264 (263,9) the worm will do him kind] The serpent will act
according to his nature.</p>
<p>V.ii.305 (205,2) He'll make demand of her, and spend that kiss,/
Which is my heaven to have] He will enquire of her concerning me,

<p>V.ii.352 (267,5) something blown] The flesh is somewhat
<i>puffed</i> or <i>swoln</i>.</p>
<p>(268) General Observation. This play keeps curiosity always
busy, and the passions always interested. The continual hurry of
the action, the variety of incidents, and the quick succession of
one personage to another, call the mind forward without
intermission from the first act to the last. But the power of
delighting is derived principally from the frequent changes of the
scene; for, except the feminine arts, some of which are too low,
which distinguish Cleopatra, no character is very strongly
discriminated. Upton, who did not easily miss what he desired to
find, has discovered that the language of Antony is, with great
skill and learning, made pompous and superb, according to his real
practice. But I think his diction not distinguishable from that of
others: the most tumid speech in the play is that which Caesar
makes to Octavia.</p>
<p>The events, of which the principal are described according to
history, are produced without any art of connexion or care of
disposition.</p>

<p>The learned commentator's [Warburton's] note must shift for
itself. I cannot but think that this passage is at present in
confusion. The poet asks a question, and stays not for an answer,

</div>
</div>
<p>This speech of the poet is very obscure. He seems to boast the
copiousness and facility of his vein, by declaring that verses drop
from a poet as gums from odoriferous trees, and that his flame
kindles itself without the violence necessary to elicit sparkles
from the flint. What follows next? that it, <i>like a current,
flies each bound it chafes</i>. This may mean, that it expands
itself notwithstanding all obstructions: but the images in the
comparison are so ill-sorted, and the effect so obscurely
expressed, that I cannot but think something omitted that connected
the last sentence with the former. It is well knovn that the
players often shorten speeches to quicken the representation; and
it may be suspected, that they sometimes performed their
amputations with more haste than judgment, (see 1765, VI, 169,
6)</p>

have shewn better. (1773)</p>

Warburton.</p>

</div>
<p>[Warburton gave the second line to Apemantus] I cannot see that
these lines are more proper in any other mouth than Timon's, to
whose character of generosity and condescension they are very
suitable. To suppose that by <i>our betters</i> are meant the Gods,
is very harsh, because to imitate the Gods has been hitherto
reckoned the highest pitch of human virtue. The whole is a trite
and obvious thought, uttered by Timon with a kind of affected
modesty. If I would make any alteration, it should be only to
reform the numbers thus:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Our betters play that game; we must not dare</i></p>
<p><i>T' imitate then; faults that are rich are fair.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I.ii.34 (289,6) thou art an Athenian,/Therefore welcome: I
myself would have no power] If this be the true reading, the sense
is, <i>all Athenians are welcome to share my fortune</i>; I would
myself have no <i>exclusive right or power in this house</i>.
Perhaps we might read, <i>I myself would have no</i> poor. I would
have every Athenian consider himself as joint possessor of my
fortune.</p>
<p>I.ii.38 (289,7) I scorn thy meat, 'twould choke me, for I
should/ Ne'er flatter thee] [W: 'fore/I should e'er] Of this
emendation there is little need. The meaning is, I could not
swallow thy meat, for I could not pay for it with flattery; and
what was given me with an ill will would stick in my throat.</p>
<p>I.ii.41 (290,8) so many dip their meat/In one man's blood] The
allusion is to a pack of hounds trained to pursuit by being
gratified with the blood of the animal which they kill, and the
wonder is that the animal on which they are feeding <i>cheers
them</i> to the chase.</p>
<p>I.ii.52 (290,9) wind-pipe's dangerous notes] The notes of the
windpipe seem to be the only indications which shew where the
windpipe is. (see 1765, VI, 184, 4)</p>
<p>I.ii.54 (290,1) My lord, in heart] That is, <i>my lord's health
with sincerity</i>. An emendation hat been proposed thus:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>My</i> love <i>in heart</i>;&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>but it is not necessary.</p>
<p>I.ii.89 (292,2) we should think ourselves for ever perfect] That
is, arrived at the perfection of happiness.</p>
<p>I.ii.94 (292,4) did not you chiefly belong to my heart?] I think
it should be inverted thus: <i>did I not chiefly belong to</i> your
hearts. Lacius wishes that Timon would give him and the rest an
opportunity <i>of expressing some part of their zeals</i>. Timon
answers that, <i>doubtless the Gods have provided that I should
have help from you; how else are you my friends</i>? why are you
stiled my friends, if&mdash;what? <i>if I do not love you</i>. Such
is the present reading; but the consequence is not very clear; the
proper close must be, <i>if you do not love me</i>, and to this my
alteration restores it. But, perhaps, the old reading may stand.
[The <i>Revisal</i>'s note on this line is quoted.] The meaning is
probably this. Why are you distinguished from thousands by that
title of endearment, was there not a particular connection and
intercourse of tenderness between you and me. (see 1765, VI, 185,
8)</p>
<p>I.ii.97 (293,5) I confirm you] I fix your characters firmly in
my own mind.</p>
<p>I.ii.99 (293,7) O joy, e'en made away, ere it can be born!] For
this Hanmer writes, <i>O joy, e'en made a joy ere't can be
born</i>; and is followed by Dr. Warburton. I am always inclinable
to think well of that which is approved by so much learning and
sagacity, yet cannot receive this alteration. Tears being the
effect both of joy and grief, supplied our author with an
opportunity of conceit, which he seldom fails to indulge. Timon,
weeping with a kind of tender pleasure, cries out, <i>O joy, e'en
made away</i>, destroyed, turned to tears, before <i>it can be
born</i>, before it can be fully possessed.</p>
<p>I.ii.110 (293,8) Mine eyes cannot hold water, methinks: to
forget their faults, I drink to you] In the original edition the
words stand thus: <i>mine eyes cannot hold out water, methinks. To
forget their faults, I drink to you</i>. Perhaps the true reading
is this, <i>Mine eyes cannot hold out</i>; they <i>water. Methinks,
to forget their faults, I will drink to you</i>. Or it may be
explained without any change. <i>Mine eyes cannot hold out
water</i>, that is, cannot keep water from breaking in upon them,
(see 1765, VI, 186, 2)</p>
<p>I.ii.113 (294,9) <i>Apem</i>. Thou weep'st to make them drink]
Hanmer reads,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>to make then drink</i> thee,</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>and is again followed by Dr. Warburton, I think without
sufficient reason. The covert sense of Apemantus is, <i>what thou
losest, they get</i>.</p>
<p>I.ii.118 (294,1) like a babe] That is a <i>weeping babe</i>.</p>

</div>
<p>[Warburton conjectured some lines lost after the second verse]
When I read this passage, I was at first of the same opinion with
this learned man; but, upon longer consideration, I grew less
confident, because I think the present reading susceptible of
explanation, with no more violence to language than is frequently
found in our author. <i>The glory of this life is very near to
madness</i>, as may be made appear from <i>this pomp</i>, exhibited
in a place where a philosopher is feeding on <i>oil and roots</i>.
When we see by example how few are the necessaries of life, we
learn what madness there is in so much superfluity.</p>

</div>
<p>This is the old reading, which apparently depends on a very low
quibble. Alcibiades is told, that <i>his estate lies in a</i>
pitch'd <i>field</i>. Now <i>pitch</i>, as Falstaff says, <i>doth
defile</i>. Alcibiades therefore replies, that his estate lies
<i>in defiled land</i>. This, as it happened, was not understood,
and all the editors published,</p>

<p>I.ii.237 (301,8) Serving of becks] [W: serring] The commentator
conceives <i>beck</i> to mean the <i>mouth</i> or the <i>head</i>,
after the French, <i>bec</i>, whereas it means a salutation made
with the head. So Milton,</p>
<div class="poem">

<p><i>Wilt give away thyself</i> in perpetuum.</p>

<p>II.i.10 (304,5) No porter at his gate;/But rather one that
smiles, and still invites] I imagine that a line is lost here, in
which the behaviour of a surly porter was described.</p>
<p>II.i.12 (304,6) no reason/Can found his state in safety] The
supposed meaning of this [Can sound his state] must be, <i>No
reason</i>, by <i>sounding</i>, fathoming, or trying, <i>his
state</i>, can find it <i>safe</i>. But as the words stand, they
imply, that <i>no reason can</i> safely <i>sound his state</i>. I
read thus,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>no reason</i></p>
<p><i>Can</i> found <i>his state in safety</i>.&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>Reason</i> cannot find his fortune to have any <i>safe</i> or
solid <i>foundation</i>.</p>
<p>The types of the first printer of this play were so worn and
defaced, that <i>f</i> and <i>s</i> are not always to be
distinguished.</p>
<p>II.ii.5 (305,9) Never mind/Was to be so unwise, to be so kind]
Of this mode of expression conversation affords many examples: "I
was always to be blamed, whatever happened." "I am in the lottery,
but I was always to draw blanks." (1773)</p>
<p>II.ii.9 (306,1) Good even, Varro] It is observable, that this
<i>good evening</i> is before dinner; for Timon tells Alcibiades,
that they will <i>go forth again as soon as dinner's done</i>,
which may prove that by <i>dinner</i> our author meant not the
<i>coena</i> of ancient times, but the mid-day's repast. I do not
suppose the passage corrupt: such inadvertencies neither author nor
editor can escape.</p>
<p>There is another remark to be made. Varro and Isidore sink a few
lines afterwards into the servants of Varro and Isidore. Whether
servants, in our author's time, took the names of their masters, I
know not. Perhaps it is a slip of negligence.</p>
<p>II.ii.47 (308,4) <i>Enter Apemantus and a Fool</i>] I suspect
some scene to be lost, in which the entrance of the fool, and the
page that follows him, was prepared by some introductory dialogue,
in which the audience was informed that they were the fool and page
of Phrynia, Timandra, or some other courtesan, upon the knowledge
of which depends the greater part of the ensuing jocularity.</p>
<p>II.ii.60-66 (309,4) Poor rogues] This is said so abruptly, that
I am inclined to think it misplaced, and would regulate the passage
thus:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Caph. <i>Where's the fool now?</i></p>
<p>Apem. <i>He last ask'd the question.</i></p>
<p>All. <i>What are we, Apemantus?</i></p>
<p>Apem. <i>Asses.</i></p>
<p>All. <i>Why?</i></p>
<p>Apem. <i>That you ask me what you are, and do not know
yourselves. Poor rogues', and usurers' men! bawds between</i></p>
<p><i>gold and want! Speak</i>, &amp;c.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Thus every word will have its proper place. It is likely that
the passage transposed was forgot in the copy, and inserted in the
margin, perhaps a little beside the proper place, which the
transcriber wanting either skill or care to observe, wrote it where
it now stands.</p>
<p>II.ii.71 (309,5) She's e'en setting on water to scald] The old
name for the disease got at Corinth was the <i>brenning</i>, and a
sense of <i>scalding</i> is one of its first symptoms.</p>
<p>II.ii.117 (311,7) with two stones more than's artificial one]
Meaning the celebrated philosopher's stone, which was in those
times much talked of. Sir Thomas Smith was one of those who lost
considerable sums in seeking of it.</p>
<p>II.ii.152 (312,9) Though you hear now, yet now's too late a

Hanmer right, and have received his emendation.</p>
<p>Il.ii.155 (313,1) and at length/How goes our reckoning?] [W:
Hold good our] It is common enough, and the commentator knows it is
common to propose interrogatively, that of which neither the
speaker nor the hearer has any doubt. The present reading may
therefore stand.</p>
<p>II.ii.171 (314,2) a wasteful cock] [i.e. a <i>cockloft</i>, a
garret. And a <i>wasteful cock</i>, signifies a garret lying in
waste, neglected, put to no use. HANMER.] Hanmer's explanation is
received by Dr. Warburton, yet I think them both apparently
mistaken. A <i>wasteful cock</i> is a <i>cock</i> or pipe with a
turning stopple <i>running</i> to <i>waste</i>. In this sense, both
the terms have their usual meaning; but I know not that <i>cock</i>
is ever used for <i>cockloft</i>, or <i>wasteful</i> for <i>lying
in waste</i>, or that lying in waste is at all a phrase.</p>
<p>Il.ii.187 (314,4) And try the arguments] [<i>Arguments</i> for
natures. <i>WARB</i>.] How <i>arguments</i> should stand for
natures I do not see. But the licentiousness of our author forces
us often upon far fetched expositions. <i>Arguments</i> may mean
<i>contents</i>, as the <i>arguments</i> of a book; or for
<i>evidences</i> and <i>proofs</i>.</p>
<p>II.ii.209 (315,5) I knew it the most general way] <i>General</i>
is not speedy, but <i>compendious</i>, the way to try many at a

<p>II.ii.219 (316,6) And so, intending other serious matters]
<i>Intending</i> is <i>regarding, turning their notice</i> to other
things.</p>
<p>II.ii.220 (316,7) these hard fractions] [Warburton saw an
allusion to fractions in mathematics] This is, I think, no conceit
in the head of Flavius, who, by <i>fractions</i>, means
<i>broken</i> hints, <i>interrupted</i> sentences, <i>abrupt</i>
remarks.</p>

<p>III.ii.51 (322,9) that I should purchase the day before for a
little part, and undo a great deal of honour?] [T: a little dirt]
This emendation is received, like all others, by sir T. Hanmer, but
neglected by Dr. Warburton. I think Theobald right in suspecting a
corruption; nor is his emendation injudicious, though perhaps we
may better read, <i>purchase the day before for a little
park</i>.</p>
<p>III.ii.71 (323,1) And just of the same piece is every

thus,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Why, this is the world's</i> sport:</p>
<p><i>Of the same piece is ev'ry flatterer's</i> soul.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The passage is not so obscure as to provoke so much enquiry.
<i>This</i>, says he, <i>is the soul</i> or spirit <i>of the world:
every flatterer</i> plays the same game, makes <i>sport</i> with
the confidence of his friend. (see 1765, VI, 211, 4)</p>
<p>III.ii.81 (324,2) He does deny him, in respect of his, What
charitable men afford to beggars] That is, <i>in respect of his</i>
fortune, what Lucius denies to Timon is in proportion to what
Lucius possesses, less than the ususal alms given by good men to
beggars.</p>
<p>III.ii.90 (324,3) I would have put my wealth into donation, And
the best half should ha' return'd to him] Hanmer reads,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>I would have put my wealth into</i> partition,</p>
<p><i>And the best half should have</i> attorn'd <i>to him</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Dr. Warbarton receives <i>attorn'd</i>. The only difficulty is
in the word <i>return'd</i>, which, since he had received nothing
from him, cannot be used but in a very low and licentious meaning,
(see 1765, VI, 212, 6)</p>
<p>III.iii.5 (325,4) They have all been touch'd] That is,
<i>tried</i>, alluding to the <i>touchstone</i>.</p>
<p>III.iii.11 (325,5) His friends, like physicians,/Thrive, give

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;his friends, (<i>like physicians</i>)</p>
<p>Thrive, give him over?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>which Theobald has misrepresented. Hanmer reads, <i>try'd</i>,
plausibly enough. Instead of <i>three</i> proposed by Mr. Pope, I
should read <i>thrice</i>. But perhaps the old reading is the
true.</p>
<p>III.iii.24 (326,6) I had such a courage] Such an ardour, such an
eager desire.</p>
<p>III.iii.28 (326,8) The devil knew not what he did] I cannot but
think that, the negative <i>not</i> has intruded into this passage,
and the reader will think so too, when he reads Dr. Warburton's
explanation of the next words.</p>
<p>III.iii.28 (326,9) The devil knew not what he did, when he made
men politick; he cross'd himself by't: and I cannot think, but in
the end the villainies of man will set him clear] [<i>Set him
clear</i> does not mean acquit him before heaven; for then <i>the
devil</i> must be supposed <i>to know what</i> he did: but it
signifies puzzle him, outdo him at his own weapons. WARBURTON.] How
the devil, or any other being, should be <i>set clear</i> by being
<i>puzzled</i> and <i>outdone</i>, the commentator has not
explained. When in a crowd we would have an opening made, we say,
<i>Stand clear</i>, that is, <i>out of the way of danger</i>. With
some affinity to this use, though not without great harshness, to
<i>set clear</i>, may be to <i>set aside</i>. But I believe the
original corruption is the insertion of the negative, which was
obtruded by some transcriber, who supposed <i>crossed</i> to mean
<i>thwarted</i>, when it meant, <i>exempted from evil</i>. The use
of <i>crossing</i>, by way of protection or purification, was
probably not worn out in Shakespeare's time. The sense of <i>set
clear</i> is now easy; he has no longer the guilt of tempting man.
To cross himself may mean, in a very familiar sense, <i>to clear
his score, to get out of debt, to quit his reckoning</i>. He knew
not <i>what he did</i>, may mean, he knew not how much good he was
doing himself. There is then no need of emendation. (1773)</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>I have printed these lines after the original copy, except that,
for <i>an honour</i>, it is there, <i>and honour</i>. All the
latter editions deviate unwarrantably from the original, and give
the lines thus:</p>
<div class="poem">

foregoing line, for, <i>lay for hearts</i>, I would read,
<i>play</i> for <i>hearts</i>.</p>
<p>III.vi.4 (339,7) Upon that were my thoughts tiring] A hawk, I

<p>IV.ii (345,1) Enter Flavius] Nothing contributes more to the

<p>IV.ii.38 (346,4) strange unusual blood] Of this passage, I
suppose, every reader would wish for a correction; but the word,

it owes its introduction. I know not what to propose. Perhaps,</p>

<p>IV.iii.6 (348,7) Not nature,/To whom all sores lay siege] I have
preserved this note rather for the sake of the commentator
[Warburton] than of the author. How <i>nature, to whom all sores
lay siege</i>, can so emphatically express <i>nature in its
greatest perfection</i>, I shall not endeavour to explain. The
meaning I take to be this: <i>Brother, when his fortune is
inlarged, will scorn brother</i>; for this is the general depravity
of human nature, which, <i>besieged as it is by misery</i>,
admonished as it is of want and imperfection, when <i>elevated by
fortune, will despise</i> beings of <i>nature like its own</i>.</p>
<p>IV.iii.12 (349,9) It is the pastor lards the brother's
sides,/The want that makes him leave] [W: weather's sides] This
passage is very obscure, nor do I discover any clear sense, even
though we should admit the emendation. Let us inspect the text as I
have given it from the original edition,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>It is the</i> pastour <i>lards the</i> brother's
<i>sides,</i></p>
<p><i>The want that makes him</i> leave.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Dr. Warburton found the passage already changed thus,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>It is the</i> pasture <i>lards the</i> beggar's
<i>sides,</i></p>
<p><i>The want that makes him</i> lean.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>And upon this reading of no authority, raised another equally
uncertain.</p>
<p>Alterations are never to be made without necessity. Let us see
what sense the genuine reading will afford. Poverty, says the poet,
<i>bears contempt hereditary</i>, and <i>wealth native honour</i>.
To illustrate this position, having already mentioned the case of a
poor and rich brother, he remarks, that this preference is given to
wealth by those whom it least becomes; <i>it is the</i> pastour
<i>that greases or</i> flatters <i>the rich</i> brother, and will
grease him on till <i>want makes him leave</i>. The poet then goes
on to ask, <i>Who dares to say this man</i>, this pastour, <i>is a
flatterer</i>; the crime is universal; through all the world <i>the
learned pate</i>, with allusion to the pastour, <i>ducks to the
golden fool</i>. If it be objected, as it may justly be, that the
mention of pastour is unsuitable, we must remember the mention of
<i>grace</i> and <i>cherubims</i> in this play, and many such
anachronisms in many others. I would therefore read thus:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>It is the pastour lards the brother's sides</i>,</p>
<p>'Tis <i>want that makes him leave</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The obscurity is still great. Perhaps a line is lost. I have at
least given the original reading.</p>
<p>IV.iii.27 (350,2) no idle votarist] No insincere or inconstant
supplicant. <i>Gold</i> will not serve me instead of
<i>roots</i>.</p>
<p>IV.iii.38 (351,5) That makes the wappen'd widow wed again] Of
<i>wappened</i> I have found no example, nor know any meaning. To
<i>awhape</i> is used by Spenser in his <i>Hubberd's Tale</i>, but
I think not in either of the senses mentioned. I would read
<i>wained</i>, for <i>decayed by time</i>. So our author in
<i>Richard the Third</i>, <i>A beauty</i>-waining <i>and distressed
widow</i>.</p>
<p>IV.iii.41 (352,6) To the April day again] That is, <i>to the
wedding day</i>, called by the poet, satirically, <i>April day</i>,
or <i>fool's day</i>.</p>
<p>IV.iii.44 (352,7) Do thy right nature] Lie in the earth where
nature laid thee.</p>
<p>IV.iii.44 (352,8) Thou'rt quick] Thou hast life and motion in
thee.</p>
<p>IV.iii.64 (353,9) I will not kiss thee] This alludes to an
opinion in former times, generally prevalent, that the venereal
infection transmitted to another, left the infecter free. I will
not, says Timon, take the rot from thy lips by kissing thee.</p>

<p>That is, <i>enough to make a whore leave whoring, and a bawd
leave making whores</i>.</p>

swear to continue whores, I will trust to your inclinations.</p>
<p>IV.iii.140 (358,1) Yet may your pains, six months,/Be quite
contrary] The explanation [Warburton's] is ingenious, but I think
it very remote, and would willingly bring the author and his
readers to meet on easier terms. We may read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>Yet may your pains six months</i></p>
<p><i>Be quite</i> contraried.&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Timon is wishing ill to mankind, but is afraid lest the whores
should imagine that he wishes well to them; to obviate which he
lets them know, that he imprecates upon them influence enough to
plague others, and disappointments enough to plague themselves. He
wishes that they may do all possible mischief, and yet take
<i>pains six months</i> of the year in vain.</p>
<p>In this sense there is a connection of this line with the next.
Finding <i>your pains contraried</i>, try new expedients, <i>thatch
your thin roofs</i>, and <i>paint</i>.</p>
<p>To <i>contrary</i> is on old verb. Latymer relates, that when he
went to court, he was advised not to <i>contrary</i> the king.</p>
<p>IV.iii.153 (359,3) mens' spurring] Hanmer reads <i>sparring</i>,
properly enough, if there be any ancient example of the word.</p>

<p>take the bridge quite away</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>[W: to forefend] The metaphor is apparently incongruous, but the
sense is good. To <i>foresee his particular</i>, is <i>to provide
for his private advantage</i>, for which <i>he leaves the right
scent of publick good</i>. In hunting, when hares have cross'd one
another, it is common for some of the hounds <i>to smell from the
general weal, and foresee their own particular</i>. Shakespeare,
who seems to have been a skilful sportsman, and has alluded often
to falconry, perhaps, alludes here to hunting.</p>
<p>To the commentator's emendation it may be objected, that he used
<i>forefend</i> in the wrong meaning. To <i>forefend</i>, is, I
think, never to <i>provide for</i>, but to <i>provide against</i>.
The verbs compounded with <i>for</i> or <i>fore</i> have commonly
either an evil or negative sense.</p>
<p>IV.iii.182 (361,8) eyeless venom'd worm] The serpent, which we,
from the smallness of his eyes, call the <i>blind worm</i>, and the
Latins, <i>caecilia</i>.</p>

declares for <i>crisp</i>, curled, bent, hollow.</p>
<p>IV.iii.188 (361,1) Let it no more bring out ingrateful man!] [W:
out to ungrateful] It is plain that <i>bring out</i> is <i>bring
forth</i>, with which the following lines correspond so plainly,
that the commentator might be suspected of writing his note without
reading the whole passage.</p>
<p>IV.iii.193 (362,2) Dry up thy marrows, vines, and plough torn
leas] I cannot concur to censure Theobald [as Warburton did] as a
<i>critic</i> very <i>unhappy</i>. He was weak, but he was
cautious: finding but little power in his mind, he rarely ventured
far under its conduct. This timidity hindered him from daring
conjectures, and sometimes hindered him happily.</p>
<p>This passage, among many others, may pass without change. The
genuine reading is not <i>marrows, veins</i>, but <i>marrows</i>,
vines: the sense is this; <i>O nature! cease</i> to <i>produce men,
ensear thy womb</i>; but if thou wilt continue to produce them, at
least cease to pamper them; <i>dry up thy marrows</i>, on which
they fatten with <i>unctuous morsels</i>, thy <i>vines</i>, which
give them <i>liquorish draughts</i>, and thy <i>plow-torn leas</i>.
Here are effects corresponding with causes, <i>liquorish
draughts</i> with <i>vines</i>, and <i>unctuous morsels</i> with
<i>marrows</i>, and the old reading literally preserved.</p>
<p>IV.iii.209 (363,3) the cunning of a carper] <i>Cunning</i> here
seems to signify <i>counterfeit appearance</i>.</p>

<p>Such was Dr. Warburton's first conjecture ["and know't too"],
but afterwards he adopted Sir T. Hanmer's conjecture,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>What a knave</i> thou!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>but there is no need of alteration. Timon had just called
Apemantus <i>fool</i>, in consequence of what he had known of him
by former acquaintance; but when Apemantus tells him, that he comes
<i>to vex him</i>, Timon determines that to <i>vex</i> is either
<i>the office of a villain or a fool</i>; that <i>to vex by
design</i> is <i>villainy, to vex without design</i> is
<i>folly</i>. He then properly asks Apemantus whether he takes
delight in <i>vexing</i>, and when he answers, <i>yes</i>, Timon
replies, <i>What! and knave too?</i> I before only knew thee to be
a <i>fool</i>, but I now find thee likewise a <i>knave</i>. This
seems to be so clear as not to stand in need of a comment.</p>
<p>IV.iii.242 (365,6) Willing misery/Out-lives incertain pomp; is

<p>IV.iii.247 (365,7) Worse than the worst, content] Best states
contentless have a wretched being, a being worse than that of the
worst states that are content. This one would think too plain to

<p>IV.iii.249 (365,8) by his breath] It means, I believe, by his
<i>counsel</i>, by his <i>direction</i>.</p>
<p>IV. iii. 252 (366,l) Hadst thou, like us] There is in this
speech a sullen haughtiness, and malignant dignity, suitable at
once to the lord and the man-hater. The impatience with which he
bears to have his luxury reproached by one that never had luxury
within his reach, is natural and graceful.</p>
<p>There is in a letter, written by the earl of Essex, just before
his execution, to another nobleman, a passage somewhat resembling
this, with which, I believe every reader will be pleased, though it
is so serious and solemn that it can scarcely be inserted without
irreverence.</p>
<p>"God grant your lordship may quickly feel the comfort I now
enjoy in my unfettered conversion, but that you may never feel the
torments I have suffered for my long delaying it. <i>I had none but
deceivers to call upon me, to whom I said, if my ambition could
have entered into their narrow breasts, they would not have been so
precise. But your lordship hath one to call upon you, that knoweth
what it is you now enjoy; and what the greatest fruit and end is of
all contentment that this world can afford.</i> Think, therefore,
dear earl, that I have staked and buoyed all the ways of pleasure
unto you, and left them as sea-marks for you to keep the channel of
religious virtue. For shut your eyes never so long, they must be
open at the last, and then you must say with me, <i>there is no
peace to the ungodly</i>."</p>
<p>IV.iii.252 (366,2) from our first swath] From infancy.
<i>Swath</i> is the dress of a new-born child.</p>
<p>IV.iii.258 (366,3) precepts of respect] Of obedience to
laws.</p>
<p>IV.iii.259 (366,4) But myself] The connection here requires some
attention. <i>But</i> is here used to denote opposition; but what
immediately precedes is not opposed to that which follows. The
adversative particle refers to the two first lines.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Thou art a slave, whom fortune's tender arm</i></p>

<p><i>&mdash;But myself,</i></p>
<p><i>Who had the world as my confectionary,</i> &amp;c.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The intermediate lines are to be considered as a parenthesis of
passion.</p>
<p>IV.iii.271 (367,5) If thou wilt curse, thy father, that poor
rag,/ Must be thy subject] If we read <i>poor rogue</i>, it will
correspond rather better to what follows.</p>
<p>IV.iii.276 (367,6) Thou hadst been knave and flatterer] Dryden
has quoted two verses of Virgil to shew how well he could have
written satires. Shakespeare has here given a specimen of the same
power by a line bitter beyond all bitterness, in which Timon tells
Apemantus, that he had not virtue enough for the vices which he
condemns.</p>
<p>Dr. Warburton explains <i>worst</i> by <i>lowest</i>, which
somewhat weakens the sense, and yet leaves it sufficiently
vigorous.</p>
<p>I have heard Mr. Bourke commend the subtilty of discrimination
with which Shakespeare distinguishes the present character of Timon
from that of Apemantus, whom to vulgar eyes he would now resemble.
(see 1763, VI, 249, 6) (rev. 1778, VIII, 424, 4)</p>
<p>IV.iii.308 (369,8) Ay, though it look like thee] Timon here
supposes that an objection against hatred, which through the whole
tenor of the conversation appears an argument for it. One would
have expected him to have answered,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Yes, <i>for it looks like thee</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The old edition, which always gives the pronoun instead of the
affirmative particle, has it,</p>
<div class="poem">

<p><i>I, though it look like thee</i>.</p>

</div>
<p>Perhaps we should read,</p>
<div class="poem">

<p><i>I</i> thought <i>it</i> look'd <i>like thee</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>IV.iii.398 (373,6) More things like men?] This line, in the old
edition, is given to Aremantus, but it apparently belongs to Timon.
Hanmer has transposed the foregoing dialogue according to his own
mind, not unskilfully, but with unwarrantable licence.</p>
<p>IV.iii.419 (373,7) you want much of meat] [T: of meet] Such is
Mr. Theobald's emendation, in which he is followed by Dr.
Warburton. Sir T. Hanmer reads,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>you want much of</i> men.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>They have been all busy without necessity. Observe the series of
the conversation. The thieves tell him, that they are <i>men that
much do want</i>. Here is an ambiguity between <i>much want</i> and
<i>want</i> of <i>much</i>. Timon takes it on the wrong side, and
tells them that their <i>greatest want is</i>, that, like other
men, <i>they want much of meat</i>; then telling them where meat
may be had, he asks, <i>Want? why want?</i> (see 1765, VI, 254,
5)</p>

</div>
<p>I do not suppose these to be imitations, but only to be similar
thoughts on similar occasions.</p>
<p>IV.iii.442 (375,2) The sea's a thief, whose liquid surge
resolves/The moon into salt tears] [W: The mounds] I am not willing
to receive <i>mounds</i>, which would not be understood but by him
that suggested it. The <i>moon</i> is supposed to be humid, and
perhaps a source of humidity, but cannot be <i>resolved</i> by the
<i>surges</i> of the sea. Yet I think <i>moon</i> is the true
reading. Here is a circulation of thievary described: The sun,
moon, and sea all rob, and are robbed.</p>
<p>IV.iii.456 (376,3) 'Tis in the malice of mankind, that he thus
advises us; not to have us thrive in our mystery] [Hanmer: his
malice to] Hanmer's emendation, though not necessary, is very
probable, and very unjustly charged with nonsense [by Warburton].
The reason of his advice, says the thief, is <i>malice to
mankind</i>, not any kindness to us, or desire <i>to have us thrive
in our mystery</i>.</p>
<p>IV.iii.468 (378,5) What an alteration of honour has/Desperate
want made!] [W: of humour] The original copy has,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>What an alteration of honour has desperate want made!</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The present reading is certainly better, but it has no
authority. To change <i>honour</i> to <i>humour</i> is not
necessary. <i>An alteration of honour</i>, is an <i>alteration</i>
of an <i>honourable state</i> to a state of disgrace.</p>
<p>IV.iii.474 (378,8)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Grant, I may ever love, and rather woe</p>
<p>Those that would mischief me, than those that do!]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>[W: rather too/...that woo] In defiance of this criticism, I
have ventured to replace the former reading, as more suitable to
the general spirit of these scenes, and as free from the
absurdities charged upon it. It is plain, that in this whole speech
<i>friends</i> and <i>enemies</i> are taken only for those who
<i>profess friendship</i> and <i>profess enmity</i>; for the
<i>friend</i> is supposed not to be more kind, but more dangerous
than the <i>enemy</i>. In the amendation, <i>those that would
mischief</i> are placed in opposition to <i>those that woo</i>, but
in the speaker's intention <i>those that woo</i> are <i>those that
mischief</i> most. The sense is, <i>Let me rather woo or caress
those that</i> would <i>mischief, that</i> profess to mean me
mischief, <i>than those</i> that really <i>do</i> me <i>mischief
under false professions of kindness</i>. The Spaniards, I think,
have this proverb; <i>Defend me from my friends, and from my
enemies I will defend myself</i>. This proverb is a sufficient
comment on the passage.</p>
<p>IV.iii.484 (379,9) all/I kept were knaves, to serve in meat to
villains] <i>Knave</i> is here in the compounded sense of a
<i>servant</i> and a <i>rascal</i>.</p>
<p>IV.iii.492 (379,1) Pity's sleeping] I do not know that any
correction is necessary, but I think we might read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>eyes do never give</i></p>
<p><i>But thorough lust and laughter, pity sleeping</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>Eyes never flow</i> (to <i>give</i> is to dissolve as saline
bodies in moist weather) <i>but by lust</i> or <i>laughter</i>,
undisturbed <i>by</i> emotions of <i>pity</i>.</p>
<p>IV.iii.499 (380,2) It almost turns my dangerous nature wild] [W:
mild] This emendation is specious, but even this may be
controverted. To <i>turn wild</i> is <i>to distract</i>. An
appearance so unexpected, says Timon, <i>almost turns my
savageness</i> to distraction. Accordingly he examines with nicety
lest his phrenzy, should deceive him,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Let me behold thy face. Surely this man</i></p>
<p><i>Was born of woman</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>And to this suspected disorder of mind he alludes,</p>
<div class="poem">

</div>
<p>IV.iii.533 (381,3) thou shalt build from men] Away from human
habitations.</p>
<p>V.i (382,5) <i>Enter Poet and Painter</i>] The poet and the
painter were within view when Apemantus parted from Timon, and
might then have seen Timon, since Apemantus, standing by him could
not see them: But the scenes of the thieves and steward have passed
before their arrival, and yet passed, as the drama is now conducted
within their view. It might be suspected that some scenes are
transposed, for all these difficulties would be removed by
introducing the poet and painter first, and the thieves in this
place. Yet I am afraid the scenes must keep their present order;
for the painter alludes to the thieves when he says, <i>he likewise
enriched poor straggling soldiers with great quantity</i>. This
impropriety is now heightened by placing the thieves in one act,
and the poet and painter in another: but it must be remembered,
that in the original edition this play is not divided into separate
acts, so that the present distribution is arbitrary, and may be
changed if any convenience can be gained, or impropriety obviated
by alteration.</p>
<p>V.i.47 (384,6) While the day serves, before black-corner'd
night] [W: black-cornette] <i>Black-corner'd night</i> is probably
corrupt, but <i>black-cornette</i> can hardly be right, for it
should be <i>black-cornetted night</i>. I cannot propose any thing,
but must leave the place in its present state. (1773)</p>
<p>V.i.101 (386,8) a made-up villain] That is a villain that adopts
qualities and characters not properly belonging to him; a
hypocrite.</p>
<p>V.i.105 (386,9) drown them in a draught] That is, <i>in the</i>
jakes.</p>
<p>V.i.109 (388,1)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>But two in company&mdash;</p>
<p>Each man apart, all single and alone,</p>
<p>Yet an arch villain keeps him company]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This passage is obscure. I think the meaning is this: <i>but two
in company</i>, that is, stand apart, <i>let only two be
together</i>; for even when each stands single there are two, he
himself and a villain.</p>
<p>V.i.151 (388,3) Of its own fall] [The Oxford editor alters
<i>fall</i> to <i>fault</i>, not knowing that Shakespeare uses
<i>fall</i> to signify dishonour, not destruction. So in
<i>Hamlet</i>,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>What a</i> falling <i>off was there</i>! WARBURTON.]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The truth is, that neither <i>fall</i> means <i>disgrace</i>,
nor is <i>fault</i> a necessary emendation. <i>Falling off</i> in
the quotation is not <i>disgrace</i> but <i>defection</i>. The
Athenians <i>had sense</i>, that is, felt the danger <i>of their
own fall</i>, by the arms of Alcibiades.</p>
<p>V.i.151 (388,4) restraining aid to Timon] I think it should be
<i>refraining aid</i>, that is, with-holding aid that should have
been given <i>to</i> Timon.</p>
<p>V.i.154 (389,5) Than their offence can weigh down by the dram]
This which was in the former editions can scarcely be right, and
yet I know not whether my reading will be thought to rectify it. I
take the meaning to be, We will give thee a recompence that our
offences cannot outweigh, <i>heaps of wealth down by the dram</i>,
or delivered according to the exactest measure. A little disorder
may perhaps have happened in transcribing, which may be reformed by
reading,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>Ay, ev'n such heaps</i></p>
<p><i>And sums of love and wealth, down by the dram,</i></p>
<p><i>As shall to thee</i>&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>V.i.165 (389,6) Allow'd with absolute power] <i>Allowed</i> is
<i>licensed</i>, <i>privileged</i>, <i>uncontrolled</i>. So of a
buffoon, in <i>Love's Labour lost</i>, it is said, that he is
<i>allowed</i>, that is, at liberty to say what he will, a
privileged scoffer.</p>
<p>V.i.139 (390,7) My long sickness/Of health and living now begins
to mend] The disease of life begins to promise me a period.</p>
<p>V.i.211 (391,8) in the sequence of degree] Methodically, from
highest to lowest.</p>
<p>V.iii.4 (393,2) Some beast read this; here does not live a man]
[W: rear'd] Notwithstanding this remark, I believe the old reading
to be the right. <i>The soldier had only seen the rude heap of
earth.</i> He had evidently seen something that told him <i>Timon
was dead</i>; and what could tell that but his tomb? The tomb he
sees, and the inscription upon it, which not being able to read,
and finding none to read it for him, he exclaims peevishly, <i>some
beast read this</i>, for it must be read, and in this place it
cannot be read by man.</p>
<p>There is something elaborately unskilful in the contrivance of
sending a soldier, who cannot read, to take the epitaph in wax,
only that it may close the play by being read with more solemnity
in the last scene.</p>
<p>V.iv.7 (394, 3) traverst arms] Arms across.</p>
<p>V.iv.8 (394,4) the time is flush] A bird is <i>flush</i> when
his feathers are grown, and he can leave the nest. <i>Flush</i> is
<i>mature</i>.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>[T: promis'd mends] Dr. Warburton agrees with Mr. Theobald, but
the old reading may well stand.</p>
<p>V.iv.28 (395,8) Shame, that they wanted cunning, in excess/Hath
broke their hearts] [Theobald had emended the punctuation] I have
no wish to disturb the means of Theobald, yet think some emendation
nay be offered that will make the construction less harsh, and the
sentence more serious. I read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Shape that they wanted, coming in excess,</i></p>
<p><i>Hath broke their hearts.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>Shame which they</i> had so long <i>wanted at last</i> coming
in <i>its utmost</i> excess.</p>
<p>V.iv.36 (396,8) not square] Not regular, not equitable.</p>
<p>V.iv.35 (397,9) uncharged ports] That is, <i>unguarded
gates</i>.</p>
<p>V.iv.59 (397,1) not a man/Shall pass his quarter] Not a soldier
shall quit his station, or be let loose upon you; and, if any
commits violence, he shall answer it regularly to the law.</p>
<p>V.iv.76 (308.,3) our brain's flow; Hanmer and Dr. Warburton
read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;brine's flow,&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Our brain's flow is our tears; but we any read our brine's flow,
our salt tears. Either will serve. (see 1765, VI, 276, 6)</p>
<p>(399) General Observation. The play of <i>Timon</i> is a
domestic tragedy, and therefore strongly fastens on the attention
of the reader. In the plan there is not much art, but the incidents
are natural, and the characters various and exact. The catastrophe
affords a very powerful warning against that ostentations
liberality, which scatters bounty, but confers no benefits, and
buys flattery, but not friendship.</p>
<p>In this tragedy are many passages perplexed, obscure, and
probably corrupt, which I have endeavoured to rectify, or explain,
with due diligence; but having only one copy, cannot promise myself
that my endeavours shall be much applauded.</p>
<h2>TITUS ANDRONICUS</h2>
<p>(403,1) It is observable, that this play is printed in the
quarto of 1611, with exactness equal to that of the other books of
those times. The first edition was probably corrected by the
author, so that here is very little room for conjecture or
emendation; and accordingly none of the editors have much molested
this piece with officious criticism.</p>
<p>I.i.70 (406,2) Hail, Rome, victorious in thy mourning weeds!]
[W: my] <i>Thy</i> is as well as <i>my</i>. We may suppose the
Romans in a grateful ceremony, meeting the dead sons of Andronicus
with mourning habits.</p>
<p>I.i.77 (407,3) Thou great defender of this Capitol] Jupiter, to
whom the Capitol was sacred.</p>
<p>I.i.168 (410,5) And fame's eternal date for virtue's praise!]
[W: In] To <i>live in fame's date</i> is, if an allowable, yet a
harsh expression. To <i>outlive</i> an <i>eternal date</i>, is,
though not philosophical, yet poetical sense. He wishes that her
life may be longer than his, and her praise longer than fame.</p>
<p>I.i.309 (414,6) changing piece] Spoken of Lavinia. <i>Piece</i>
was then, as it is now, used personally as a word of contempt.</p>
<p>II.i (421,8) In the quarto, the direction is, <i>Manet
Aaron</i>, and he is before made to enter with Tamora, though he
says nothing. This scene ought to continue the first act.</p>
<p>II.i.9 (421,9) So Tamora&mdash;/Upon her wit doth earthly honour
wait] [W: her will] I think <i>wit</i>, for which she is eminent in
the drama, is right.</p>
<p>II.i.116 (425,2) by kind] That is, by <i>nature</i>, which is
the old signification of <i>kind</i>.</p>
<p>II.ii (425,3) <i>Changes to a Forest</i>] The division of this
play into acts, which was first made by the editors in 1623, is
improper. There is here an interval of action, and here the second
act ought to have begun.</p>

come at this gold of the empress are to suffer by it.</p>
<p>II.iii.72 (430,9) swarth Cimmerian] <i>Swarth</i> is
<i>black</i>. The Moor is called Cimmerien, from the affinity of
blackness to darkness.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">

</div>
</div>
<p>He had yet been married but one night.</p>
<p>II.iii.104 (431,2) Should straight fall mad, or else die
suddenly] This is said in fabulous physiology, of those that hear
the groan of the mandrake torn up.</p>
<p>II.iii.126 (432,3) And with that painted hope she braves your
mightiness] [W: cope] <i>Painted hope</i> is only <i>specious</i>
hope, or ground of confidence more plausible than solid.</p>
<p>II.iii.227 (435,4) A precious ring, that lightens all the hole]
There is supposed to be a gem called a carbuncle, which emits not
reflected but native light. Mr. Boyle believes the reality of its
existence.</p>
<p>II.iv.13 (438,5) If I do dream, 'would all my wealth would wake
me'] If this be a dream, I would give all my possessions to be
delivered from it by waking.</p>
<p>III.i.91 (443,8) It was my deer] The play upon <i>deer</i> and
<i>dear</i> has been used by Waller, who calls a lady's girdle,
<i>The pale that held my lovely</i> deer.</p>
<p>III.i.216 (447,1) And do not break into these deep extremes] [We
should read, instead of this nonsense,</p>
<div class="poem">

</div>
<p>i.e. extremes caused by excessive sorrow. But Mr. Theobald, on
his own authority, alters it to <i>deep</i>, without notice given.
WARB.] It is <i>deep</i> in the old quarto of 1611, (rev. 1778,
VIII, 510, 8)</p>
<p>III.ii (450,2) <i>An apartment in Titus's house</i>] This scene,
which does not contribute any thing to the action, yet seems to
have the same author with the rest, is omitted in the quarto of
1611, but found in the folio of 1623.</p>

it seems to bear another hue] We may better read, <i>In that it</i>
scorns <i>to bear another hue</i>.</p>
<p>IV.iii.88 (466,1) Yet wrung with wrongs] To <i>wring</i> a horse
is to press or strain his back.</p>
<p>IV.iv.90 (472,4) With words more sweet, and yet more dangerous,/
Than baits to fish, or honey-stalks to sheep] <i>Honey-stalks</i>
are clover-flowers, which contain a sweet juice. It is common for
cattle to over-charge themselves with clover, and die.</p>
<p>V.i.102 (476,7) As true a dog, as ever fought at head] An
allusion to bull-dogs, whose generosity and courage are always
shown by meeting the bull in front, and seizing his nose.</p>
<p>V.ii.189 (484,1) And of the paste a coffin will I rear] A
<i>coffin</i> is the term of art for the cavity of a raised
pye.</p>
<p>V.iii.19 (486,2) break the parley] That is, <i>begin</i> the
parley. We yet say, he <i>breaks</i> his mind.</p>
<p>(492) General Observation. All the editors and critics agree
with Mr. Theobald in supposing this play spurious. I see no reason
for differing from them; for the colour of the stile is wholly
different from that of the other plays, and there is an attempt at
regular versification, and artificial closes, not always inelegant,
yet seldom pleasing. The barbarity of the spectacles, and the
general massacre, which are here exhibited, can scarcely be
conceived tolerable to any audience; yet we are told by Jonson,
that they were not only borne, but praised. That Shakespeare wrote
any part, though Theobald declares it <i>incontestible</i>, I see
no reason for believing.</p>
<p>The testimony produced at the beginning of this play, by which
it is ascribed to Shakespeare, is by no means equal to the argument
against its authenticity, arising from the total difference of
conduct, language, and sentiments, by which it stands apart from
all the rest. Meeres had probably no other evidence than that of a
title-page, which, though in our time it be sufficient, was then of
no great authority; for all the plays which were rejected by the
first collectors of Shakespeare's works, and admitted in later
editions, and again rejected by the critical editors, had
Shakespeare's name on the title, as we must suppose, by the
fraudulence of the printers, who, while there were yet no gazettes,
nor advertisements, nor any means of circulating literary
intelligence, could usurp at pleasure any celebrated name. Nor had
Shakespeare any interest in detecting the imposture, as none of his
fame or profit was produced by the press.</p>
<p>The chronology of this play does not prove it not to be
Shakespeare's. If it had been written twenty-five years, in 1614,
it might have been written when Shakespeare was twenty-five years
old. When he left Warwickshire I know not, but at the age of
twenty-five it was rather too late to fly for deer-stealing.</p>
<p>Ravenscroft, who in the reign of Charles II, revised this play,
and restored it to the stage, tells us, in his preface, from a
theatrical tradition, I suppose, which in his time might be of
sufficient authority, that this play was touched in different parts
by Shakespeare, but written by some other poet. I do not find
Shakespeare's touches very discernible, (see 1765, VI, 364) (rev.
1778, VIII, 559)</p>

<h2>TROILUS AND CRESSIDA</h2>
<p>Prologue. (4,2)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>And hither am I come</i></p>
<p><i>A prologue arm'd; but not in confidence</i></p>
<p><i>Of author's pen, or actor's voice; but suited</i></p>
<p><i>In like conditions as our argument</i>]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I come here to speak the prologue, and come in armour; not
defying the audience, in confidence of either the author's or
actor's abilities, but merely in a character suited to the subject,
in a dress of war, before a warlike play.</p>
<p>I.i.12 (8,3) And skill-less as unpractis'd infancy] Mr. Dryden,
in his alteration of this play, has taken this speech as it stands,
except that he has changed <i>skill-less</i> to <i>artless</i>, not
for the better, because <i>skill-less</i> refers to <i>skill</i>
and <i>skilful</i>.</p>
<p>I.i.58 (10,4) The cignet's down is harsh, and spirit of
sense/Hard as the palm of ploughman!] <i>In comparison with</i>
Cressid's <i>hand</i>, says he, <i>the spirit of sense</i>, the
utmost degree, the most exquisite power of sensibility, which
implies a soft hand, since the sense of touching, as Scaliger says
in his <i>Exercitations</i>, resides chiefly in the fingers, is
hard as the callous and insensible palm of the ploughman. WARBURTON
reads,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;SPITE <i>of sense</i>:</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>HANMER,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;to th' <i>spirit of sense</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It is not proper to make a lover profess to praise his mistress
in <i>spite of sense</i>; for though he often does it in <i>spite
of the sense</i> of others, his own senses are subdued to his
desires.</p>
<p>I.i.66 (10,5) if she be fair, 'tis the better for her; an she be
not, she has the mends in her own hands] She may mend her
complexion by the assistance of cosmeticks.</p>
<p>I.ii.4 (12,1) Hector, whose patience/Is, as a virtue, fix'd] [W:
Is as the] I think the present text may stand. Hector's patience
was as a virtue, not variable and accidental, but fixed and
constant. If I would alter it, it should be thus:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;Hector, whose patience</p>
<p>Is ALL a virtue fix'd,&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>All</i>, in old English, is the <i>intensive</i> or enforcing
particle.</p>
<p>I.ii.8 (13,2) Before the sun rose, he was harness'd light]
[Warburton stated that "harnessed light" meant Hector was to fight
on foot] How does it appear that Hector was to fight on foot rather
to-day than on any other day? It is to be remembered, that the
ancient heroes never fought on horseback; nor does their manner of
fighting in chariots seem to require less activity than on
foot.</p>
<p>I.ii.23 (14,4) his valour is crushed into folly] To be
<i>crushed into folly</i>, is to be <i>confused</i> and mingled
with <i>folly</i>, so as that they make one mass together.</p>
<p>I.ii.46 (15,6) Ilium] Was the palace of Troy.</p>
<p>I.ii.120 (17,7) compass-window] The <i>compass-window</i> is the
same as the <i>bow-window</i>. (1773)</p>
<p>I.ii.212 (20,2)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Cre.</i> Will he give you the nod?</p>
<p><i>Pan.</i> You shall see.</p>
<p><i>Cre.</i> If he do, the rich shall have more]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>[W: rich] I wonder why the commentator should think any
emendation necessary, since his own sense is fully expressed by the
present reading. Hanmer appears not to have understood the passage.
That to <i>give the nod</i> signifies to <i>set a mark of
folly</i>, I do not know; the allusion is to the word <i>noddy</i>,
which, as now, did, in our author's time, and long before, signify,
<i>a silly fellow</i>, and may, by its etymology, signify likewise
<i>full of nods</i>. Cressid means, that <i>a</i> noddy <i>shall
have more</i> nods. Of such remarks as these is a comment to
consist?</p>
<p>I.ii.260 (22,3) money to boot] So the folio. The old quarto,
with more force, Give <i>an eye</i> to boot. (rev. 1778, IX, 25,
1)</p>
<p>I.ii.285 (22,4) upon my wit to defend my wiles] So read both the
copies) yet perhaps the author wrote,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Upon my wit to defend my will.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The terms <i>wit</i> and <i>will</i> were, in the language of
that time, put often in opposition.</p>
<p>I.ii.300 (23,5) At your own house; there he unarms him] [These
necessary words added from the quarto edition. POPE.] The words
added are only, <i>there he unarms him</i>.</p>
<p>I.ii.313 (23,6) joy's soul lies in the doing] So read both the
old editions, for which the later editions have poorly given,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;the <i>soul's joy</i> lies in doing.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I.ii.316 (23,7) That she] Means, that woman.</p>
<p>I.iii.31 (25,2) With due observance of thy godlike seat] [T:
godlike seat] This emendation [for goodly seat] Theobald might have
found in the quarto, which has,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;the <i>godlike</i> seat.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I.iii.32 (25,3) Nestor shall apply/Thy latest words] Nestor
<i>applies</i> the words to another instance.</p>
<p>I.iii.54 (26,7) Returns to chiding fortune] For <i>returns</i>,
Hanmer reads <i>replies</i>, unnecessarily, the sense being the
same. The folio and quarto have <i>retires</i>, corruptly.</p>
<p>I.iii.62 (27,8)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>both your speeches; which are such,</p>

<p>Should with a bond of air (strong as the axle-tree</p>
<p>On which heaven rides) knit all the Greekish ears</p>
<p>To his experienc'd tongue]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Ulysses begins his oration with praising those who had spoken
before him, and marks the characteristick excellencies of their
different eloquence, strength, and sweetness, which he expresses by
the different metals on which he recommends them to be engraven for
the instruction of posterity. The speech of Agamemnon is such that
it ought to be engraven in brass, and the tablet held up by him on
the one side, and Greece on the other, to shew the union of their
opinion. And Nestor ought to be exhibited in silver, uniting all
his audience in one mind by his soft and gentle elocution. Brass is
the common emblem of strength, and silver of gentleness. We call a
soft voice a <i>silver</i> voice, and a persuasive tongue a
<i>silver</i> tongue.&mdash;I once read for <i>hand</i>, the
<i>band</i> of Greece, but I think the text right.&mdash;To
<i>hatch</i> is a term of art for a particular method of
<i>engraving</i>. <i>Hatcher</i>, to cut, Fr.</p>
<p>I.iii.78 (28,1) The specialty of rule] The particular rights of
supreme authority.</p>
<p>I.iii.81 (29,2) When that the general is not like the hive] The
meaning is, <i>When the general is not</i> to the army <i>like the
hive</i> to the bees, the repository of the stock of every
individual, that to which each particular resorts with whatever be
has collected for the good of the whole, <i>what honey is
expected</i>? what hope of advantage? The sense is clear, the
expression is confused.</p>
<p>I.iii.101 (30,5) Oh, when degree is shak'd] I would read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;So when degree is shak'd. (see 1765, VII, 431, 5)</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Then</i> enterprize is sick!&mdash;</p>

<p>I.iii.104 (30,7) brotherhoods in cities] Corporations,

<p>I.iii.128 (31,8) That by a pace goes backward] That goes
backward <i>step by step</i>.</p>
<p>I.iii.128 (31,9) with a purpose/It hath to climb] With a design
in each man to aggrandize himself, by slighting his immediate
superior.</p>
<p>I.iii.134 (31,1) bloodless emulation] An emulation not vigorous
and active, but malignant and sluggish.</p>
<p>I.iii.152 (31,2) Thy topless deputation] <i>Topless</i> is that
has nothing <i>topping</i> or <i>overtopping</i> it; supreme;
sovereign.</p>
<p>I.iii.167 (32,3) as near as the extremest ends/Of parallels] The
parallels to which the allusion seems to be made are the parallels
on a map. As like as East to West.</p>
<p>I.iii.179 (32,4)</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p>All our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,</p>

<p>The meaning is this, All our good <i>grace exact</i>, means of
<i>excellence irreprehensible</i>.</p>
<p>I.iii.184 (32,5) to make paradoxes] <i>Paradoxes</i> may have a
meaning, but it is not clear and distinct. I wish the copies had
given,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;to make <i>parodies</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I.iii.188 (33,6) bears his head/In such a rein] That is, holds
up his head as haughtily. We still say of a girl, <i>she
bridles</i>.</p>
<p>I.iii.196 (33,7) How rank soever rounded in with danger] A
<i>rank weed</i> is a <i>high weed</i>. The modern editions
silently read,</p>
<div class="poem">

<p>How <i>hard</i> soever&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p><i>By</i> their observant toil, <i>of</i> th' enemies'

</div>
<p>I.iii.220 (34,1) Achilles' arm] So the copies. Perhaps the
author wrote,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>Alcides'</i> arm.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I.iii.262 (35,4) long continu'd truce] Of this long <i>truce</i>
there has been no notice taken; in this very act it is said, that
<i>Ajax coped Hector yesterday in the battle</i>.</p>
<p>I.iii.270 (36,7) (With truant vows to her own lips he loves)]
That is, <i>confession made with idle vows to the lips of her whom
he loves</i>.</p>
<p>I.iii.319 (37,1) nursery] Alluding to a plantation called a
nursery.</p>
<p>I.iii.341 (38,4) scantling] That is, a <i>measure</i>,
<i>proportion</i>. The carpenter cuts his wood to a certain
<i>scantling</i>.</p>
<p>I.iii.343 (38,5) small pricks] Small <i>points compared</i> with
the volumes.</p>
<p>II.i (40,1) <i>The Grecian camp. Enter Ajax and Thorsites</i>]
ACT II.] This play is not divided into acts in any of the original
editions.</p>
<p>II.i.13 (41,2) The plague of Greece] Alluding perhaps to the
plague sent by Apollo on the Grecian army.</p>
<p>II.i.15 (41,3) Speak then, thou unsalted leaven, speak] [T:
unwinnow'dst] [W: windyest] Hanmer preserves <i>whinid'st</i>, the
reading of the folio; but does not explain it, nor do I understand
it. If the folio be followed, I read, <i>vinew'd</i>, that is
<i>mouldy leven</i>. Thou composition of <i>mustiness</i> and
<i>sourness</i>.&mdash;Theobald's assertion, however confident, is
false. <i>Unsalted</i> leaven is in the old quarto. It means
<i>sour</i> without <i>salt</i>, malignity without wit. Shakespeare
wrote first <i>unsalted</i>; but recollecting that want of
<i>salt</i> was no fault in leaven, changed it to
<i>vinew'd</i>.</p>
<p>II.i.38 (42,5) aye that thou bark'st at him] I read, <i>O</i>
that thou <i>bark'dst</i> at him.</p>
<p>II.i.42 (42,6) pun thee into shivers] <i>Pun</i> is in the
midland counties the vulgar and colloquial word for <i>pound</i>.
(1773)</p>
<p>II.i.125 (45,1) when Achilles' brach bids me] The folio and
quarto read, <i>Achilles'</i> brooch. <i>Brooch</i> is an appendant
ornament. The meaning may be, equivalent to one of <i>Achilles'
hangers on</i>.</p>
<p>II.ii.29 (47,2) The past-proportion of his infinite?] Thus read
both the copies. The meaning is, <i>that greatness, to which no
measure bears any proportion</i>. The modern editors silently
give,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>The <i>vast</i> proportion&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>II.ii.58 (48,4) And the will dotes that is inclinable] [Old
edition, not so well, has it, <i>attributive</i>. POPE.] By the old
edition Mr. Pope means the old quarto. The folio has, as it stands,
<i>inclinable</i>.&mdash;I think the first reading better; <i>the
will dotes that attributes</i> or gives <i>the qualities which it
affects</i>; that first causes excellence, and then admires it.</p>
<p>II.ii.60 (48,5) Without some image of the affected merit] The
present reading is right. The will <i>affects</i> an object for
some supposed <i>merit</i>, which Hector says, is uncensurable,
unless the <i>merit</i> so <i>affected</i> be really there.</p>
<p>II.ii.71 (48,7) unrespective sieve] That is, into a <i>common
voider</i>. <i>Sieve</i> is in the quarto. The folio reads,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;unrespective <i>fame</i>;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>for which the modern editions have silently printed,</p>
<div class="poem">

</div>
<p>II.ii.88 (49,9)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">

<p>And do a deed that fortune never did,</p>
<p>Beggar that estimation which you priz'd</p>
<p>Richer than sea and land?]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>If I understand this passage, the meaning is, "Why do you, by
censuring the determination of your own wisdoms, degrade Helen,
whom fortune has not yet deprived of her value, or against whom, as
the wife of Paris, fortune has not in this war so declared, as to
make us value her less?" This is very harsh, and much strained.</p>
<p>II.ii.122 (50,2) her brain-sick raptures/Cannot distaste the
goodness of a quarrel] Corrupt; change to a worse state.</p>
<p>II.ii.179 (52,3) benummed wills] That is, inflexible,
inmoveable, no longer obedient to superior direction.</p>
<p>II.ii.180 (52,4) There is a law in each well-ordered nation]
What the law does in every nation between individuals, justice
ought to do between nations.</p>
<p>II.ii.188 (52,5) Hector's opinion/Is this in way of truth]
Though considering <i>truth</i> and <i>justice</i> in this
question, this is my opinion; yet as a question of honour, I think
on it as you.</p>
<p>II.ii.196 (53,6) the performance of our heaving spleens] The
execution of spite and resentment.</p>
<p>II.ii.212 (53,7) emulation] That is, envy, factious
contention.</p>
<p>II.iii.18 (54,8) without drawing the massy iron and cutting the
web] That is, <i>without drawing their swords to cut the web</i>.
They use no means but those of violence.</p>
<p>II.iii.55 (55,1) decline the whole question] Deduce the question
from the first case to the last.</p>
<p>II.iii.108 (57,6) but it was a strong composure, a fool could
disunite] So reads the quarto very properly; but the folio, which
the moderns have followed, has, <i>it was a strong</i> COUNSEL.</p>
<p>II.iii.118 (57,7) noble state] Person of high dignity; spoken of
Agamemnon.</p>
<p>II.iii.137 (58,8) under-write] To <i>subscribe</i>, in
Shakespeare, is to <i>obey</i>.</p>
<p>II.iii.215 (60,2) pheese his pride] To <i>pheese</i> is to
<i>comb</i> or <i>curry</i>.</p>
<p>II.iii.217 (60,3) Not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel]
Not for the value of all for which we are fighting.</p>
<p>II.iii.267 (62,6)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Ajax.</i> Shall I call you father?</p>
<p><i>Nest.</i> Ay, my good son]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the folio and in the nodern editions Ajax desires to give the
title of <i>father</i> to Ulysses; in the quarto, more naturally,
to Nestor.</p>
<p>III.i.35 (64,1) love's invisible soul] <i>love's</i> visible
<i>soul</i>.] So HANMER. The other editions have <i>invisible</i>,
which perhaps may be right, and may mean the <i>soul of love</i>
invisible every where else.</p>
<p>III.i.83 (65,3) And, my lord, he desires you] Here I think the
speech of Pandarus should begin, and the rest of it should be added
to that of Helen, but I have followed the copies.</p>
<p>III.i.96 (65,4) with my disposer Cressida] [W: dispouser] I do
not understand the word <i>disposer</i>, nor know what to
substitute in its place. There is no variation in the copies.</p>
<p>III.i.132 (67,6) <i>Yet that which seems the wound to kill</i>]
<i>To kill the wound</i> is no very intelligible expression, nor is
the measure preserved. We might read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2"><i>These lovers cry,</i></p>
<p class="i2"><i>Oh! oh! they die!</i></p>
<p>But <i>that which seems to kill,</i></p>
<p class="i2"><i>Doth turn</i>, &amp;c.</p>
<p><i>So dying love lives still</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Yet as <i>the wound to kill</i> may mean <i>the wound that seems
mortal</i>, I alter nothing.</p>
<p>III.ii.25 (69,1) tun'd too sharp in sweetness]&mdash;and <i>too
sharp in sweetness</i>,] So the folio and all modern editions; but
the quarto more accurately,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>tun'd</i> too sharp in sweetness.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>III.ii.99 (71,4) our head shall go bare, 'till merit crown it] I
cannot forbear to observe, that the quarto reads thus: <i>Our head
shall go bare, 'till merit</i> lower part no affection, <i>in
reversion</i>, &amp;c. Had there been no other copy, hov could this
have been corrected? The true reading is in the folio.</p>
<p>III.ii.102 (72,5) his addition shall be humble] We will give him
no high or pompous titles.</p>
<p>III.ii.162 (74,6)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i6">but you are wise,</p>
<p>Or else you love not; to be wise and love,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;but <i>we're not</i> wise,</p>
<p>Or else <i>we</i> love not; to be wise and love,</p>
<p>Exceeds man's might;&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Cressida, in return to the praise given by Troilus to her
wisdom, replies, "That lovers are never wise; that it is beyond the
power of man to bring love and wisdom to an union."</p>
<p>III.ii.173 (74,8) Might be affronted with the match] I wish "my
integrity might be met and matched with such equality and force of
pure unmingled love."</p>
<p>III.ii.184 (75,2) As true as steel, as plantage to the moon]
<i>Plantage</i> is not, I believe, a general term, but the herb
which we now call <i>plantain</i>, in Latin, <i>plantago</i>, which
was, I suppose, imagined to be under the peculiar influence of the
moon.</p>
<p>III.ii.187 (76,3)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Yet after all comparisons of truth,</p>
<p>As truth's authentic author to be cited</p>
<p><i>As true as Troilus</i>, shall crown up the verse]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Troilus shall <i>crown the verse</i>, as a man <i>to be cited as
the authentic author of truth</i>; as one whose protestations were
true to a proverb.</p>
<p>III.iii.1-16 (77,5) Now, princes, for the service I have done
you] I am afraid, that after all the learned commentator's
[Warburton's] efforts to clear the argument of Calchas, it will
still appear liable to objection; nor do I discover more to be
urged in his defence, than that though his skill in divination
determined him to leave Troy, jet that he joined himself to
Agamemnon and his army by unconstrained good-will; and though he
came as a fugitive escaping from destruction, yet his services
after his reception, being voluntary and important, deserved
reward. This argument is not regularly and distinctly deduced, but
this is, I think, the best explication that it will yet admit.</p>
<p>III.iii.4 (78,6) through the sight I bear in things, to Jove]
This passage in all the modern editions is silently depraved, and
printed thus:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;through the sight I bear in things to come.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The word is so printed that nothing but the sense can determine
whether it be <i>love</i> or <i>Jove</i>. I believe that the
editors read it as <i>love</i>, and therefore made the alteration
to obtain some meaning.</p>
<p>III.iii.28 (79,7)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>he shall buy my daughter; and her presence</p>
<p>Shall quite strike off all service I have done,</p>
<p>In most accepted pain]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Sir T. HANMER, and Dr. WARBURTON after him, read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>In most accepted <i>pay</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>They do not seem to understand the construction of the passage.
<i>Her presence</i>, says Calchas, shall strike off, or recompence
<i>the service I have done</i>, even in these <i>labours</i> which
were <i>most accepted</i>.</p>
<p>III.iii.44 (80,8) derision med'cinable] All the modern editions
have <i>decision</i>. The old copies are apparently right. The
folio in this place agrees with the quarto, so that the corruption
was at first merely accidental.</p>
<p>III.iii.96 (82,9) how dearly ever parted] I do not think that in
the word <i>parted</i> is included any idea of <i>division</i>; it
means, <i>however excellently endowed</i>, with however <i>dear</i>
or precious <i>parts</i> enriched or adorned.</p>
<p>III.iii.113 (82,2) but the author's drift:/Who, in his
circumstance] In the detail or circumduction of his argument.</p>
<p>III.iii.125 (83,3) The unknovn Ajax] Ajax, who has abilities
which were never brought into view or use.</p>

<p>To <i>creep</i> is to <i>keep out of sight</i> from whatever
motive. Some men <i>keep out of notice in the hall of Fortune</i>,
while others, though they but <i>play the idiot</i>, are always
<i>in her eye</i>, in the way of distinction.</p>
<p>III.iii.137 (83,5) feasting] Folio. The quarto has
<i>fasting</i>. Either word may bear a good sense.</p>
<p>III.iii.145 (84,6) Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back]
This speech is printed in all the modern editions with such
deviations from the old copy, as exceed the lawful power of an
editor.</p>
<p>III.iii.171 (85,2) for beauty, wit,/High birth, vigour of bone,
desert in service] The modern editors read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>For beauty, wit, high birth, desert in service, &amp;c.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I do not deny but the changes produce a more easy lapse of
numbers, but they do not exhibit the work of Shakespeare, (see
1765, VII, 435, 2)</p>
<p>III.iii.178 (85,3)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>And shew to dust, that is a little gilt,</p>
<p>More laud than gilt o'er-dusted]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>[T: give to ... laud than they will give to gold] This
emendation has been received by the succeeding editors, but recedes
too far from the copy. There is no other corruption than such as
Shakespeare's incorrectness often resembles. He has omitted the
article <i>to</i> in the second line: he should have written,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>More laud than</i> to <i>gilt o'er-dusted</i>. (1773) (rev.
1778, IX, 93, 7)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>III.iii.189 (86,4) Made emulous missions] The meaning of
<i>mission</i> seems to be <i>dispatches</i> of the gods <i>from
heaven</i> about mortal business, such as often happened at the
siege of Troy.</p>
<p>III.iii.197 (86,5) Knows almost every grain of Pluto's gold] For
this elegant line the quarto has only,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Knows almost every <i>thing</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>III.iii.201 (86,7) (with which relation/Durst never meddle)]
There is a secret administration of affairs, which no

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Omission to do what is necessary</p>

</div>
<p>By <i>neglecting</i> our duty we <i>commission</i> or enable
that <i>danger</i> of dishonour, which could not reach us before,
to lay hold upon us.</p>
<p>III.iii.254 (88,1) with a politic regard] With a <i>sly
look</i>.</p>
<p>IV.i.11 (91,1) During all question of the gentle truce] I once
thought to read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>During all <i>quiet</i> of the gentle truce.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>But I think <i>question</i> means intercourse, interchange of
conversation.</p>
<p>IV.i.36 (92,4) His purpose meets you] I bring you his meaning
and his orders.</p>
<p>IV.i.65 (93,6)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Both merits pois'd, each weighs no less nor more,</p>

</div>
<p>I read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>But he as he, <i>each</i> heavier for a whore.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>Heavy</i> is taken both for <i>weighty</i>, and for
<i>sad</i> or <i>miserable</i>. The quarto reads,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>But he as he, <i>the</i> heavier for a whore.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I know not whether the thought is not that of a wager. It must
then be read thus:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>But he as he. Which heavier for a whore?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>That is, <i>for a whore</i> staked down, <i>which is the
heavier</i>.</p>
<p>IV.i.78 (94,7) We'll not commend what we intend to sell] I
believe the meaning is only this: though you practise the buyer's
art, we will not practise the seller's. We intend to sell Helen
dear, yet will not commend her.</p>
<p>IV.ii.62 (96,4) My matter is so rash] My business is so
<i>hasty</i> and so abrupt.</p>
<p>IV.ii.74 (97,6) the secrets of neighbour Pandar] [Pope had
emended the Folio's "secrets of nature" to the present reading] Mr.
Pope's reading is in the old quarto. So great is the necessity of
collation.</p>
<p>IV.iv.3 (99,1) The grief] The folio reads,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>The grief is fine, full perfect, that I taste,</p>
<p>And no less in a sense as strong</p>
<p>As that which causeth it.&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The quarto otherwise,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>The grief is fine, full, perfect, that I taste,</p>
<p>And <i>violenteth</i> in a sense as strong</p>
<p>As that which causeth it.&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>Violenteth</i> is a word with which I am not acquainted, yet
perhaps it may be right. The reading of the text is without
authority.</p>
<p>IV.iv.65 (101,3) For I will throw my glove to death] That is, I
will <i>challenge</i> death himself in defence of thy fidelity.</p>
<p>IV.iv.105 (103,5)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>While others fish, with craft, for great opinion,</p>
<p>I, with great truth, catch mere simplicity.]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The meaning, I think, is, <i>while others</i>, by their art,
gain high estimation, I, by honesty, obtain a plain simple
approbation.</p>
<p>IV.iv.109 (103,6) the moral of my wit/Is, <i>plain and true</i>]
That is, the <i>governing principle of my understanding</i>; but I
rather think we should read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;the <i>motto</i> of my wit</p>
<p>Is, plain and true,&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>IV.iv.114 (103,7) possess thee what she is] I will <i>make thee
fully understand</i>. This sense of the word <i>possess</i> is
frequent in our author.</p>
<p>IV.iv.134 (104,9) I'll answer to my list] This, I think, is
right, though both the old copies read <i>lust</i>.</p>
<p>IV.v.8 (105,1) bias cheek] Swelling out like the bias of a
bowl.</p>
<p>IV.v.37 (106,3) I'll make my match to live./The kiss you take is
better than you give] I will make such <i>bargains</i> as I may
live by, <i>such as may bring me profit</i>, therefore will not
take a worse kiss than I give.</p>
<p>IV.v.48 (107,4) Why, beg then] For the sake of rhime we should
read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Why beg <i>two</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>If you think kisses worth begging, beg more than one.</p>
<p>IV.v.52 (107,5) Never's my day, and then a kiss of you] I once
gave both these lines to Cressida. She bids Ulysses beg a kiss; he
asks that he may have it,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>When Helen is a maid again&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>She tells him that then he shall have it:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>When Helen is a maid again&mdash;</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Cre.</i> I am your debtor, claim it when 'tis due;</p>
<p>Never's my day, and then a kiss <i>for</i> you.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>But I rather think that Ulysses means to slight her, and that
the present reading is right.</p>
<p>IV.v.57 (107,6) motive of her body] <i>Motive</i> for <i>part
that contributes to motion</i>.</p>
<p>IV.v.59 (107,7) a coasting] An amorous address; courtship.</p>
<p>IV.v.62 (107,8) sluttish spoils of opportunity] Corrupt wenches,
of whose chastity every opportunity may make a prey.</p>
<p>IV.v.73 (108,9) <i>Aga.</i> 'Tis done like Hector, but securely
done] [Theobald gave the speech to Achilles] As the old copies
agree, I have made no change.</p>
<p>IV.v.79 (108,1) Valour and pride excel themselves in Hector]
Shakespeare's thought is not exactly deduced. Nicety of expression
is not his character. The cleaning is plain, "Valour (says AEneas)
is in Hector greater than valour in other men, and pride in Hector
is less than pride in other men. So that Hector is distinguished by
the excellence of having pride less than other pride, and valour
more than other valour."</p>
<p>IV.v.103 (109,2) an impair thought] A thought suitable to the
dignity of his character. This word I should have changed to
<i>impure</i>, were I not over-powered by the unanimity of the
editors, and concurrence of the old copies, (rev. 1778, IX, 120,
8)</p>
<p>IV.v.105 (109,3) Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes/To
tender objects] That is, <i>yields, gives</i> way.</p>
<p>IV.v.112 (110,4) thus translate him to me] Thus <i>explain his
character</i>.</p>
<p>IV.v.142 (111,5) <i>Hect.</i> Not Neoptolemus so mirable] [W:
Neoptolemus's sire irascible] After all this contention it is
difficult to imagine that the critic believes <i>mirable</i> to
have been changed to <i>irascible</i>. I should sooner read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Not Neoptolemus th' admirable;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>as I know not whether <i>mirable</i> can be found in any other
place. The correction which the learned commentator gave to
Hanmer,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Not Neoptolemus' <i>sire</i> so mirable,</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>as it was modester than this, was preferable to it. But nothing
is more remote from justness of sentiment, than for Hector to
characterise Achilles as the father of Neoptolemus, a youth that
had not yet appeared in arms, and whose name was therefore much
less knovn than his father's. My opinion is, that by Neoptolemus
the author meant Achilles himself; and remembering that the son was
Pyrrhus Neoptolemus, considered Neoptolemus as the nomen
gentilitium, and thought the father was likewise Achilles
Neoptolemus.</p>
<p>IV.v.147 (112,6) We'll answer it] That is, answer the
<i>expectance</i>.</p>
<p>IV.v.275 (117,5) Beat loud the tabourines] For this the quarto
and the latter editions have,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>To taste your bounties.&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The reading which I have given from the folio seems chosen at
the revision, to avoid the repetition of the word
<i>bounties</i>.</p>
<p>V.i.5 (118,1) Thou crusty batch of nature] <i>Batch</i> is
changed by Theobald to <i>botch</i>, and the change is justified by
a pompous note, which discovers that he did not know the word
<i>batch</i>. What is more strange, Hanmer has followed him.
<i>Batch</i> is any thing <i>baked</i>.</p>
<p>V.i.19 (119,3) Male-varlet] HANMER reads <i>male-harlot</i>,
plausibly enough, except that it seems too plain to require the
explanation which Patroclus demands.</p>
<p>V.i.23 (119,4) cold palsies] This catalogue of loathsome
maladies ends in the folio at <i>cold palsies</i>. This passage, as
it stands, is in the quarto: the retrenchment was in my opinion
judicious. It may be remarked, though it proves nothing, that, of
the few alterations made by Milton in the second edition of his
wonderful poem, one was, an enlargement of the enumeration of
diseases.</p>
<p>V.i.32 (119,5) you ruinous butt; you whoreson indistinguishable
cur] Patroclos reproaches Thersites with deformity, with having one
part crowded into another.</p>
<p>V.i.35 (119,6) thou idle immaterial skeyn of sley'd silk] All
the terms used by Thersites of Patroclus, are emblematically
expressive of flexibility, compliance, and mean officiousness.</p>
<p>V.i.40 (119,7) Out, gall!] HANMER reads <i>nut-gall</i>, which
answers well enough to <i>finch-egg</i>; it has already appeared,
that our author thought the <i>nut-gall</i> the bitter gall. He is
called <i>nut</i>, from the conglobation of his form; but both the
copies read, <i>Out, gall</i>!</p>
<p>V.i.41 (120,8) Finch egg!] Of this reproach I do not know the
exact meaning. I suppose he means to call him <i>singing bird</i>,
as implying an useless favourite, and yet more, something more
worthless, a singing bird in the egg, or generally, a slight thing
easily crushed.</p>
<p>V.i.64 (121,2) forced with wit] Stuffed with wit. A term of
cookery.&mdash;In this speech I do not well understand what is
meant by <i>loving quails</i>.</p>
<p>V.i.73 (121,3) spirits and fires!] This Thersites speaks upon
the first sight of the distant lights.</p>
<p>V.ii.11 (124,1) And any man may sing her, if he can take her
cliff] That is, her <i>key</i>. <i>Clef</i>, French.</p>
<p>V.ii.41 (125,2) You flow to great distraction] So the moderns.
The folio has,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>You <i>flow</i> to great <i>distraction</i>.&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The quarto,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>You <i>flow</i> to great <i>destruction</i>.&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>You <i>show too</i> great distraction.&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>V.ii.108 (128,7) But with my heart the other eye doth see] I
think it should be read thus,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>But <i>my heart with</i> the other eye doth see.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>V.ii.113 (128,8) A proof of strength she could not publish more]
She could not publish a stronger proof.</p>
<p>V.ii.125 (129,1) I cannot conjure, Trojan] That is, I cannot
raise spirits in the form of Cressida.</p>
<p>V.ii.141 (129,2) If there be rule in unity itself] I do not well
understand what is meant by <i>rule in unity</i>. By <i>rule</i>
our author, in this place as in others, intends <i>virtuous
restraint, regularity of manners, command of passions and
appetites</i>. In Macbeth,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause</p>
<p>Within the belt of rule.&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>But I know not how to apply the word in this sense to
<i>unity</i>. I read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>If there be rule in <i>purity</i> itself,</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Or, If there be rule in <i>verity</i> itself.</p>
<p>Such alterations would not offend the reader, who saw the state
of the old editions, in which, for instance, a few lines lower,
<i>the almighty sun</i> is called <i>the almighty
fenne</i>.&mdash;Yet the words may at last mean, If there be
<i>certainty</i> in <i>unity</i>, if it be a <i>rule</i> that
<i>one is one</i>.</p>
<p>V.ii.144 (130,3) Bi-fold authority!] This is the reading of the
quarto. The folio gives us,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>By foul</i> authority!&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>There is <i>madness</i> in that disquisition in which a man
reasons at once <i>for</i> and <i>against himself upon
authority</i> which he knows <i>not to be valid</i>. The quarto is
right.</p>
<p>V.ii.144 (130,4)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i6">where reason can revolt</p>
<p>Without perdition, and loss assume all reason</p>
<p>Without revolt]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The words <i>loss</i> and <i>perdition</i> are used in their
common sense, but they mean the <i>loss</i> or <i>perdition</i> of
<i>reason</i>.</p>
<p>V.ii.157 (131,6) And with another knot five-finger-tied] A knot
tied by giving her hand to Diomed.</p>
<p>V.ii.160 (131,7) o'er-eaten faith] Vows which she has already
swallowed <i>once over</i>. We still say of a faithless man, that
he has <i>eaten his words</i>.</p>
<p>V.ii.161 (131,8)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Ulyss.</i> May worthy Troilus be half attach'd</p>
<p>With that which here his passion doth express!]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Can Troilus really feel on this occasion half of what he utters?
A question suitable to the calm Ulysses.</p>
<p>V.iii.21 (133,2)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>For us to count we give what's gain'd by thefts,</p>
<p>And rob in the behalf of charity]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is so oddly confused in the folio, that I transcribe it as
a specimen of incorrectness:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;do not count it holy,</p>
<p>To hurt by being just; it were as lawful</p>
<p><i>For we would count give much to as violent thefts</i>,</p>
<p>And rob in the behalf of charity.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>V.iii.23 (133,3)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Cas.</i> It is the purpose that makes strong the vow;</p>
<p>But vows to every purpose must not hold]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The mad prophetess speaks here with all the coolness and
judgment of a skilful casuist. "The essence of a lawful vow, is a
lawful purpose, and the vow of which the end is wrong must not be
regarded as cogent."</p>
<p>V.iii.27 (134,4)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Life every man holds dear; but the dear man</p>
<p>Holds honour far more precious dear than life]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>Valuable</i> man. The modern editions read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>brave</i> man.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The repetition of the word is in our author's manner.</p>
<p>V.iii.37 (134,5)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Brother, you have a vice of mercy in you,</p>
<p>Which better fits a lion, than a man]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The traditions and stories of the darker ages abounded with
examples of the lion's generosity. Upon the supposition that these
acts of clemency were true, Troilus reasons not improperly, that to
spare against reason, by mere instinct of pity, became rather a
generous beast than a wise man.</p>
<p>V.x.33 (137,9) Hence, broker lacquey!] For <i>brothel</i>, the
folio reads <i>brother</i>, erroneously for <i>broker</i>, as it
stands at the end of the play where the lines are repeated. Of
<i>brother</i> the following editors made <i>brothel</i>.</p>
<p>V.iv.18 (138,2) the Grecians begin to proclaim barbarism, and
policy grows into an ill opinion] To set up the authority of
ignorance to declare that they will be governed by policy no
longer.</p>
<p>V.vi.11 (142,1) you cogging Greeks] This epithet has no
particular propriety in this place, but the author had heard of
<i>Graecia Mendax</i>.</p>
<p>V.vi.29 (144,3) I'll frush it] The word <i>frush</i> I never
found elsewhere, nor understand it. HANMER explains it, to
<i>break</i> or <i>bruise</i>.</p>
<p>V.viii.7 (146,1) Even with the vail and darkening of the sun]
The <i>vail</i> is, I think, the <i>sinking</i> of the sun; not
<i>veil</i> or <i>cover</i>.</p>
<p>(149) General Observation. This play is more correctly written
than most of Shakespeare's compositions, but it is not one of those
in which either the extent of his views or elevation of his fancy
is fully displayed. As the story abounded with materials, he has
exerted little invention; but he has diversified his characters
with great variety, and preserved them with great exactness. His
vicious characters sometimes disgust, but cannot corrupt, for both
Cressida and Pandarus are detested and contemned. The comic
characters seem to have been the favourites of the writer; they are
of the superficial kind, and exhibit more of manners than nature;
but they are copiously filled and powerfully impressed. Shakespeare
has in his story followed, for the greater part, the old book of
Caxton, which was then very popular; but the character of
Thersites, of which it makes no mention, is a proof that this play
was written after Chapman had published his version of
<i>Homer</i>.</p>
<h2>CYMBELINE</h2>
<p>I.i.1 (153,2)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>You do not meet a man, but frowns: our bloods</p>
<p>No more obey the heavens, than our courtiers'</p>
<p>Still seen, as does the king's]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>[W: brows/No more] This passage is so difficult, that
commentators may differ concerning it without animosity or shame.
Of the two emendations proposed, Hanmer's is the more licentious;
but he makes the sense clear, and leaves the reader an easy
passage. Dr. Warburton has corrected with more caution, but less
improvement: his reasoning upon his own reading is so obscure and
perplexed, that I suspect some injury of the press.&mdash;I am now
to tell my opinion, which is, that the lines stand as they were
originally written, and that a paraphrase, such as the licentious
and abrupt expressions of our author too frequently require, will
make emendation unnecessary. <i>We do not meet a man but frowns;
our bloods</i>&mdash;our countenances, which, in popular speech,
are said to be regulated by the temper of the blood,&mdash;<i>no
more obey</i> the laws of <i>heaven</i>,&mdash;which direct us to
appear what we really are,&mdash;<i>than our
courtiers</i>;&mdash;that is, than the <i>bloods of our
courtiers</i>; but our bloods, like theirs,&mdash;<i>still seem, as

<p>I.i.46 (156,4) liv'd in court,/(Which rare it is to do) most
prais'd, most lov'd] This encomium is high and artful. To be at
once in any great degree <i>loved</i> and <i>praised</i> is truly
<i>rare</i>.</p>
<p>I.i.49 (156,5) A glass that feated them] <i>A glass that

I know not by whom first substituted, for</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>A glass that <i>feared</i> them;&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I have displaced <i>featur'd</i>, though it can plead long
prescription, because I am inclined to think that <i>feared</i> has
the better title. <i>Mirrour</i> was a favourite word in that age
for an <i>example</i>, or a <i>pattern</i>, by noting which the
manners were to be formed, as dress is regulated by looking in a
glass. When Don Bellianis is stiled <i>The Mirrour of
Knighthood</i>, the idea given is not that of a glass in which
every knight may behold his own resemblance, but an example to be
viewed by knights as often as a glass is looked upon by girls, to
be viewed, that they may know, not what they are, but what they
ought to be. Such a glass may <i>fear the more mature</i>, as
displaying excellencies which they have arrived at maturity without
attaining. To <i>fear</i> is here, as in other places, to
<i>fright</i>. [I believe Dr. Johnson is mistaken as to the reading
of the folio, which is <i>feated</i>. The page of the copy which he
consulted is very faintly printed; but I have seen another since,
which plainly gives this reading. STEEVENS.] If <i>feated</i> be
the right word, it must, I think, be explained thus; <i>a glass
that</i> formed <i>them</i>; a model, by the contemplation and
inspection of which they formed their manners. (see 1765, VII, 260,

<p>I.i.101 (158,2) Though ink be made of gall] Shakespeare, even in

</div>
<p>It seems to me, even from SKINNER, whom he cites, that
<i>yare</i> is used only as a personal quality. Nor is the
authority of Skinner sufficient, without some example, to justify
the alteration. HANMER's reading is better, but rather too far from
the original copy:</p>

<p>I.i.135 (160,5) a touch more rare/Subdues all pangs, all fears]

<p>I.i.140 (161,6) a puttock] A <i>kite</i>.</p>
<p>I.ii.31 (163,1) her beauty and her brain go not together] I

always, beauty and brain go not together."</p>
<p>I.ii.32 (164,2) She's a good sign] [W: shine] There is acuteness

<p>As he could <i>mark</i> me with his eye, or <i>I</i></p>
<p>Distinguish&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The reason of Hanmer's reading was, that Pisanio describes no
address made to the <i>ear</i>.</p>
<p>I.iii.18 (165,3) till the diminution/Of space had pointed him
sharp as my needle] <i>The diminution of space</i>, is <i>the
diminution</i> of which <i>space</i> is the cause. Trees are killed
by a blast of lightning, that is, by <i>blasting</i>, not
<i>blasted</i> lightning.</p>
<p>I.iii.24 (166,4) next vantage] Next <i>opportunity</i>.</p>
<p>I.iii.37 (166,6) Shakes all our buds from growing] A bud,
without any distinct idea, whether of flower or fruit, is a natural
representation of any thing incipient or immature; and the buds of
flowers, if flowers are meant, <i>grow</i> to flowers, as the buds
of fruits <i>grow</i> to fruits.</p>
<p>I.iv.9 (167,1) makes him] In the sense in which we say, This
will <i>make</i> or <i>mar</i> you.</p>
<p>I.iv.16 (167,2) words him, I doubt not, a great deal from the
matter] Makes the description of him very distant from the
truth.</p>
<p>I.iv.20 (167,3) under her colours] Under her banner; by her
influence.</p>
<p>I.iv.47 (168,6) I was then a young traveller; rather shunn'd to
go even with what I heard, than in my every action to be guided by
others' experiences] This is expressed with a kind of fantastical
perplexity. He means, I was then willing to take for my direction
the experience of others, more than such intelligence as I had
gathered myself.</p>
<p>I.iv,58 (169,7) 'Twas a contention in publick, which may,
without contradiction, suffer the report] Which, undoubtedly, may
be publickly told.</p>
<p>I.iv.73 (169,8) tho' I profess myself her adorer, not her
friend] Though I have not the common obligations of a lover to his
mistress, and regard her not with the fondness of a friend, but the
reverence of an adorer.</p>
<p>I.iv.77 (169,9) If she went before others I have seen, as that
diamond of yours out-lustres many I have beheld, I could not
believe she excelled many] [W: could believe] I should explain the
sentence thus: "Though your lady excelled, as much as your diamond,
<i>I could not believe she excelled many</i>; that is, I too
<i>could</i> yet <i>believe that there are</i> many <i>whom</i> she
did not excel." But I yet think Dr. Warburton right. (1773)</p>

<p>I.iv.148 (172,4) You are a friend, and therein the wiser. If you
buy ladies' flesh at a million a dram, you cannot preserve it from
tainting. But, I see, you have some religion in you, that you fear]
<i>You are a friend</i> to the lady, <i>and therein the wiser</i>,
as you will not expose her to hazard; and that you <i>fear</i>, is
a proof of your <i>religious</i> fidelity. (see 1765, VII, 276,
1)</p>
<p>I.iv.l60 (173,5) <i>Iach.</i> If I bring you no sufficient
testimony that I have enjoy'd the dearest bodily part of your

she your jewel, this your jewel, and my gold are yours&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Post.</i> I embrace these conditions]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>[W: bring you sufficient] I once thought this emendation right,
but am now of opinion, that Shakespeare intended that Iachimo,
having gained his purpose, should designedly drop the invidious and
offensive part of the wager, and to flatter Posthumus, dwell long
upon the more pleasing part of the representation. One condition of
a wager implies the other, and there is no need to mention
both.</p>
<p>I.v.18 (176,1) Other conclusions] Other <i>experiments</i>. <i>I
commend</i>, says WALTON, <i>an angler that tries</i> conclusions,
and improves his art.</p>
<p>I.v.23 (175,2) Your highness/Shall from this practice but make
hard your heart] Thare is in this passage nothing that much
requires a note, yet I cannot forbear to push it forward into
observation. The thought would probably have been more amplified,
had our author lived to be shocked with such experiments as have
been published in later times, by a race of men that have practised
tortures without pity, and related then without shame, and are yet
suffered to erect their heads among human beings.</p>

<p>I.v.33-44 (175,3) I do not like her] This soliloquy is very

he is neither resolving, repenting, suspecting, nor deliberating,

<p>I am willing to comply with any meaning that can be extorted
from the present text, rather than change it, yet will propose, but

enjoyments.</p>
<p>I.vi.35 (180,2) and the twinn'd stones/Upon the number'd beach?]
I know not well how to regulate this passage. <i>Number'd</i> is
perhaps <i>numerous</i>. <i>Twinn'd stones</i> I do not understand.
<i>Twinn'd shells</i>, or <i>pairs of shells</i>, are very common.
For <i>twinn'd</i>, we might read <i>twin'd</i>; that is,
<i>twisted, convolved</i>; but this sense is more applicable to
shells than to stones.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>[i.e. that appetite, which is not allured to feed on such
excellence, can have no stomach at all; but, though empty, must
nauseate every thing. WARB.] I explain this passage in a sense
almost contrary. Iachimo, in this counterfeited rapture, has shewn
how the <i>eyes</i> and the <i>judgment</i> would determine in
favour of Imogen, comparing her with the present mistress of
Posthumus, and proceeds to say, that appetite too would give the
same suffrage. <i>Desire</i>, says he, when it approached
<i>sluttery</i>, and considered it in comparison with <i>such neat
excellence</i>, would not only be <i>not so allured to feed</i>,
but, seized with a fit of loathing, <i>would vomit emptiness</i>,
would feel the convulsions of disgust, though, being unfed, it had
nothing to eject. [Tyrwhitt: vomit, emptiness ... allure] This is
not ill conceived; but I think my own explanation right. <i>To
vomit emptiness</i> is, in the language of poetry, to feel the
convulsions of eructation without plenitude. (1773)</p>
<p>I.vi.54 (182,4) He's strange, and peevish] He is a foreigner,
easily fretted.</p>
<p>I.vi.97 (184,5) timely knowing] Rather timely <i>known</i>.</p>
<p>I.vi.99 (184,6) What both you spur and stop] What it is that at
once incites you to speak, and restrains you from it. [I think
Imogen means to enquire what is that news, that intelligence, or
information, you profess to bring, and yet with-hold: at least, I
think Dr. JOHNSON's explanation a mistaken one, for Imogen's
request supposes Iachimo an agent, not a patient. HAWKINS.] I think
my explanation true. (see 1765, VII, 286, 7)</p>

<p>The author of the present regulation of the text I do not know,

hands.</p>
<p>I.vi.122 (185,8) With tomboys, hir'd with that

<p>I.vi.152 (186,9) As in a Romish stew] The stews of Rome are
deservedly censured by the reformed. This is one of many instances
in which Shakespeare has mingled in the manners of distant ages in
this play.</p>
<p>II.i.2 (188,1) kiss'd the jack upon an up-cast] He is describing
his fate at bowls. The <i>jack</i> is the small bowl at which the
others are aimed. He who is nearest to it wins. <i>To kiss the
jack</i> is a state of great advantage. (1773)</p>

the same as of <i>fellow</i> now. It was a word of contempt.</p>

<p>II.ii.13 (191,2) Did softly press the rushes] It was the custom
in the time of our author to strew chambers with rushes, as we now
cover them with carpets. The practice is mentioned in <i>Caius de

<p>II.iii.28 (195,3) <i>With, every thing that pretty bin</i>] is

talk.</p>
<p>II.iii.118-129 (199,8) The contract you pretend with that base
wretch] Here Shakespeare has not preserved, with his common nicety,
the uniformity of character. The speech of Cloten is rough and
harsh, but certainly not the talk of one,</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>WARBURTON.] But why nonsense? A <i>self-figured knot</i> is a
knot formed by yourself. (see 1765, VII, 301, 8)</p>
<p>II.iv.71 (204,4) And Cydnus swell'd above the banks, or for/The
press of boats, or pride] [This is an agreeable ridicule on
poetical exaggeration, which gives human passions to inanimate
things: and particularly, upon what he himself writes in the
foregoing play on this very subject:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"&mdash;And made</p>
<p>The water, which they beat, to follow faster,</p>
<p>As amorous of their strokes."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>WARBURTON.] It is easy to sit down and give our author meanings
which he never had. Shakespeare has no great right to censure
poetical exaggeration, of which no poet is more frequently guilty.
That he intended to ridicule his own lines is very uncertain, when
there are no means of knowing which of the two plays was written
first. The commentator has contented himself to suppose, that the
foregoing play in his book was the play of earlier composition. Nor
is the reasoning better than the assertion. If the language of
Iachimo be such as shews him to be mocking the credibility of his
hearer, his language is very improper, when his business was to
deceive. But the truth is, that his language is such as a skilful
villain would naturally use, a mixture of airy triumph and serious
deposition. His gaiety shews his seriousness to be without anxiety,
and his seriousness proves his gaiety to be without art.</p>
<p>II.iv.83 (205,5) never saw I figures/So likely to report
themselves] So near to speech. The Italians call a portrait, when
the likeness is remarkable, a <i>speaking picture</i>.</p>
<p>II.iv.84 (205,6) the cutter/Was as another nature, dumb,
out-went her;/Motion and breath left out] [W: done; out-went her.]
This emendation I think needless. The meaning is this, The
<i>sculptor</i> was as <i>nature</i>, but as <i>nature dumb</i>; he
gave every thing that nature gives, but <i>breath</i> and
<i>motion</i>. In <i>breath</i> is included <i>speech</i>.</p>
<p>II.iv.91 (205,7) <i>Post.</i> This is her honour!] [T: What's
this t'her honour?] This emendation has been followed by both the
succeeding editors, but I think it must be rejected. The expression
is ironical. Iachimo relates many particulars, to which Posthumus
answers with impatience, This is her honour! That is, And the
attainment of this knowledge is to pass for the corruption of her
honour.</p>

<p>This passage may, in my opinion, be very easily understood,
without any emendation. The lady says, "I can see neither one way
nor other, before me nor behind me, but all the ways are covered
with an impenetrable fog." There are objections insuperable to all
that I can propose, and since reason can give me no counsel, I will
resolve at once to follow my inclination.</p>
<p>III.iii.5 (218,2) giants may jet through/And keep their impious
turbans on] The idea of a <i>giant</i> was, among the readers of
romances, who were almost all the readers of those times, always
confounded with that of a Saracen.</p>
<p>III.iii.16 (218,3) This service it not service, so being
done,/But being so allow'd] In war it is not sufficient to do duty
well; the advantage rises not from the act, but the acceptance of
the act.</p>
<p>III.iii.23 (219,5) Richer, than doing nothing for a babe] I have
always suspected that the right reading of this passage is what I
had not in my former edition the confidence to propose: Richer,
than doing nothing for a <i>brabe</i>.</p>
<p><i>Brabium</i> is a badge of honour, or the ensign of an honour,
or any thing worn as a mask of dignity. The word was strange to the
editors as it will be to the reader: they therefore changed it to
<i>babe</i>; and I am forced to propose it without the support of
any authority. <i>Brabium</i> is a word found in Holyoak's
Dictionary, who terms it a <i>reward</i>. Cooper, in his
<i>Thesaurus</i>, defines it to be a <i>prize, or reward for any
game</i>. (1773) (rev. 1778, IX, 248, 8)</p>
<p>III.iii.35 (219,6) To stride a limit] To overpass his bound.</p>
<p>III.iii.35 (220,7) What should we speak of,/When we are as old
as you?] This dread of an old age, unsupplied with matter for
discourse and meditation, is a sentiment natural and noble. No
state can be more destitute than that of him who, when the delights
of sense forsake him, has no pleasures of the mind.</p>

</div>
<p>That is, they are trained up in the <i>cave, where their

habitation, <i>hit the roofs of palaces</i>. In other words, though
their condition is low, their thoughts are high. The sentence is at
last, as THEOBALD remarks, abrupt, but perhaps no less suitable to
Shakespeare. I know not whether Dr. WARBURTON's conjecture be not
better than mine.</p>
<p>III.iii.101 (223,2) I stole these babes] Shakespeare seems to
intend Belarius for a good character, yet he makes him forget the
injury which he has done to the young princes, whom he has robbed
of a kingdom only to rob their father of heirs.&mdash;The latter
part of this soliloquy is very inartificial, there being no

</div>
</div>
<p>To wear a dark mind, is to carry a mind impenetrable to the
search of others. <i>Darkness</i> applied to the <i>mind</i> is
<i>secrecy</i>, applied to the <i>fortune</i> is <i>obscurity</i>.
The next lines are obscure. <i>You must</i>, says Pisanio,

<i>in its proper form</i>, cannot yet appear without great

<p>I think it very natural to reflect in this distress on the

</div>
</div>
<p>WARBURTON.]</p>
<p>I cannot perceive the second line to be intolerable, or to be
nonsense. The speaker only rises in his ideas. <i>She has all
courtly parts</i>, says he, <i>more exquisite than</i> any
<i>lady</i>, than all <i>ladies</i>, than all <i>womankind</i>. Is
this nonsense?</p>
<p>III.v.101 (236,3) <i>Pia.</i> Or this, or perish] These words, I
think, belong to Cloten, who, requiring the paper, says,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Let's see't: I will pursue her</p>
<p>Even to Augustus' throne. Or this, or perish.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>III.vi.12 (239,1) To lapse in fullness/Is sorer, than to lye for
need] Is a <i>greater</i>, or <i>heavier</i> crime.</p>
<p>III.vi.23 (239,3) If any thing that's civil, speak; if
savage,/Take, or lend] [W: Take 'or 't end.] I suppose the
emendation proposed will not easily be received; it is strained and
obscure, and the objection against Hanmer's reading is likewise
very strong. I question whether, after the words, <i>if savage</i>,
a line be not lost. I can offer nothing better than to read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;Ho! who's here?</p>
<p>If any thing that's civil, <i>take or lend</i>,</p>

</div>
<p>If you are <i>civilised</i> and <i>peaceable, take</i> a price
for what I want, or <i>lend</i> it for a future recompence; if you
are <i>rough inhospitable</i> inhabitants of the mountain,
<i>speak</i>, that I may know my state.</p>
<p>III.vi.77 (242,4) then had my prize/Been less; and so more equal
ballasting] HANMER reads plausibly, but without necessity,
<i>price</i>, for <i>prize</i>, and <i>balancing</i>, for
<i>ballasting</i>. He is followed by Dr. WARBURTON. The meaning is,
Had I been a less prize, I should not have been too heavy for
Posthumus.</p>
<p>III.vi.86 (243,5) That nothing-gift of differing multitudes] [T:
deferring] He is followed by Sir T. HANMER and Dr. WARBURTON; but I
do not see why <i>differing</i> may not be a general epithet, and
the expression equivalent to the <i>many-headed</i> rabble.</p>
<p>III.vii.8 (244,2)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>and to you, the tribunes,</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The plain meaning is, he <i>commands</i> the commission to be
given to you. So we say, I <i>ordered</i> the materials to the
workmen.</p>
<p>IV.ii.10 (245,1) Stick to your journal course: the breach of
custom/ Is breach of all] Keep your <i>daily</i> course
uninterrupted; if the stated plan of life is once broken, nothing
follows but confusion.</p>
<p>IV.ii.17 (246,2) How much the quantity] I read, <i>As</i> much
the quantity.&mdash;</p>
<p>IV.ii.38 (247,3) I could not stir him] Not <i>move</i> him to
tell his story.</p>
<p>IV.ii.39 (247,4) gentle, but unfortunate] <i>Gentle</i>, is
<i>well born</i>, of birth above the vulgar.</p>
<p>IV.ii.59 (248,6) And let the stinking elder, Grief, untwine/ His
perishing root, with the encreasing vine!] Shakespeare had only
seen <i>English vines</i> which grow against walls, and therefore
may be sometimes entangled with the <i>elder</i>. Perhaps we should
read <i>untwine from the vine</i>.</p>
<p>IV.ii.105 (251,9) the snatches in his vice,/And burst of
speaking] This is one of our author's strokes of observation. An
abrupt and tumultuous utterance very frequently accompanies a
confused and cloudy understanding.</p>
<p>IV.ii.111 (251,1) for the effect of judgment/Is oft the cause of
fear] HANMER reads, with equal justness of sentiment,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;for defect of judgment</p>
<p>Is oft the <i>cure</i> of fear.&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>But, I think, the play of <i>effect</i> and <i>cause</i> more
resembling the manner of our author.</p>
<p>IV.ii.118 (252,2) I am perfect, what] I am <i>well informed</i>,
what. So in this play,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>I'm <i>perfect</i>, the Pannonians are in arms.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>IV.ii.121 (252,3) take us in] To <i>take in</i>, was the phrase
in use for to <i>apprehend</i> an out-law, or to make him amenable
to public justice.</p>
<p>IV.ii.148 (253,5) the boy Fidele's sickness/Did make my way long
forth] Fidele's sickness made my <i>walk forth</i> from the cave
<i>tedious</i>.</p>
<p>IV.ii.159 (254,6) revenges/That possible strength might meet]
Such pursuit of vengeance as fell within any possibility of
opposition.</p>
<p>IV.ii.168 (254,7) I'd let a parish of such Clotens blood] [W:
marish] The learned commentator has dealt the raproach of nonsense
very liberally through this play. Why this is nonsense, I cannot
discover. I would, says the young prince, to recover Fidele, kill
as many Clotens as would fill a <i>parish</i>.</p>
<p>IV.ii.246 (258,1) He was paid for that] HANMER reads,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>He <i>has</i> paid for that:&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>rather plausibly than rightly. <i>Paid</i> is for

<p>"Twenty things more, my friend, which you know due,</p>

<p>IV.ii.247 (258,2) reverence,/(That angel of the world)]

keeps peace and order in the world.</p>
<p>IV.ii.268 (259,4) <i>The scepter, learning, physic, must/ All
follow this, and come to dust</i>] The poet's sentiment seems to
have been this. All human excellence is equally the subject to the
stroke of death: neither the power of kings, nor the science of
scholars, nor the art of those whose immediate study is the
prolongation of life, can protect then from the final destiny of
man. (1773)</p>
<p>IV.ii.272 (260,5) <i>Fear not slander, censure rash</i>]
Perhaps, Fear not <i>slander's</i> censure rash.</p>
<p>IV.ii.275 (260,6) Consign to thee] Perhaps, Consign to
<i>this</i>. And in the former stanza, for <i>all follow this</i>,
we might read, <i>all follow</i> thee.</p>
<p>IV.ii.280 (260,7) Both. <i>Quiet consummation have;/ And
renowned be thy grave!</i>] For the obsequies of Fidele, a song was
written by my unhappy friend, Mr. William Collins of Chichester, a
man of uncommon learning and abilities. I shall give it a place at
the end in honour of his memory.</p>
<p>IV.ii.315 (262,1) Conspired with] The old copy reads thus,</p>

</div>
</div>

</div>
</div>
<p>IV.ii.346 (263,2) Last night the very gods shew'd me a vision]
[W: warey] Of this meaning I know not any example, nor do I see any
need of alteration. It was no common dream, but sent from <i>the
very gods</i>, or the gods themselves.</p>
<p>IV.ii.363 (264,3)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>who was he,</p>
<p>That, otherwise than noble nature did,</p>
<p>Hath alter'd that good figure?]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here are many words upon a very slight debate. The sense is not
much cleared by either critic [Theobald and Warburton]. The
question is asked, not about a <i>body</i>, but a <i>picture</i>,
which is not very apt to grow shorter or longer. To <i>do</i> a
picture, and a picture is well <i>done</i>, are standing phrases;
the question therefore is, Who has altered this picture, so as to
make it otherwise than nature <i>did</i> it.</p>
<p>IV.ii.389 (266,5) these poor pickaxes] Meaning her fingers.</p>
<p>IV.iii (266,1) <i>Cymbeline's palace</i>] This scene is omitted
against all authority by Sir T. HANMER. It is indeed of no great
use in the progress of the fable, yet it makes a regular
preparation for the next act.</p>
<p>IV.iii.22 (267,3) our jealousy/Does yet depend] My suspicion is
yet undetermined; if I do not condemn you, I likewise have not
acquitted you. We now say, the <i>cause</i> is
<i>depending</i>.</p>
<p>IV.iii.29 (267,4) Your preparation can affront no less/Than what
you hear of] Your forces are able to <i>face</i> such an army as we
hear the enemy will bring against us.</p>
<p>IV.iii.44 (268,6) to the note o' the king] I will so distinguish
myself, the king shall remark my valour.</p>
<p>IV.iv.11 (269,1) a render/Where we have liv'd] An account of our
place of abode. This dialogue is a just representation of the
superfluous caution of an old man.</p>
<p>IV.iv.13 (269,2) That which we have done, whose answer would be
death] The <i>retaliation</i> of the death of Cloten would be
<i>death</i>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>IV.iv.18 (269,3) their quarter'd fires] Their fires regularly
disposed.</p>
<p>V.i (271,1) <i>Enter Posthumus, with a bloody handkerchief</i>]
The bloody token of Imogen's death, which Pisanio in the foregoing
act determined to send.</p>
<p>V.i.1-33 (271,2) Yea, bloody cloth, I'll keep thee] This is a
soliloquy of nature, uttered when the effervescence of a mind
agitated and perturbed spontaneously and inadvertently discharges
itself in words. The speech, throughout all its tenor, if the last
conceit be excepted, seems to issue warm from the heart. He first
condemns his own violence; then tries to disburden himself, by
imputing part of the crime to Pisanio; he next sooths his mind to
an artificial and momentary tranquility, by trying to think that he
has been only an instrument of the gods for the happiness of
Imogen. He is now grown reasonable enough to determine, that having
done so much evil he will do no more; that he will not fight
against the country which he has already injured; but as life is
not longer supportable, he will die in a just cause, and die with
the obscurity of a man who does not think himself worthy to be
remembered.</p>
<p>V.i.9 (271,3) to put on] Is to <i>incite</i>, to
<i>instigate</i>.</p>
<p>V.i.14 (272,4) To second ills with ills, each elder worse] For
this reading all the later editors have contentedly taken,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;each worse than other,</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>without enquiries whence they have received it. Yet they know,
or might know, that it has no authority. The original copy
reads,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;each elder worse,</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The last deed is certainly not the oldest, but Shakespeare calls
the <i>deed</i> of an <i>elder</i> man an <i>elder deed</i>.</p>
<p>V.i.15 (272,5) And make them dread it, to the doers' thrift] [T:
dreaded, to] This emendation ia followed by HANMER. Dr. WARBURTON
reads, I know not whether by the printer's negligence,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>And make them <i>dread</i>, to the doers' thrift.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>There seems to be no very satisfactory sense yet offered. I
read, but with hesitation,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>And make them <i>deeded</i>, to the doers' thrift.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The word <i>deeded</i> I know not indeed where to find; but
Shakespeare has, in another sense <i>undeeded</i>, in
<i>Macbeth</i>:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"&mdash;my sword</p>
<p>"I sheath again <i>undeeded</i>."&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I will try again, and read thus,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;others you permit</p>
<p>To second ills with ills, each other worse,</p>
<p>And make them <i>trade it</i>, to the doers' thrift.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>Trade</i> and <i>thrift</i> correspond. Our author plays with
<i>trade</i>, as it signifies a lucrative vocation, or a frequent
practice. So Isabella says,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Thy sins, not accidental, but a <i>trade</i>."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>V.i.16 (273,9) Do your best wills,/And make me blest to obey!]
So the copies. It was more in the manner of our author to have
written,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;Do your blest wills,</p>
<p>And make me blest t' obey.&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>V.iii.41 (276,3) A rout, confusion thick] [W: confusion-thick] I
do not see what great addition is made to <i>fine diction</i> by
this compound. Is it not as natural to enforce the principal event
in a story by repetition, as to enlarge the principal figure in a
figure?</p>
<p>V.iii.51 (276,4) bugs] Terrors.</p>
<p>V.iii.53 (277,5) Nay, do not wonder at it] [T: do but] There is
no need of alteration. Posthumus first bids him not wonder, then
tells him in another mode of reproach, that wonder is all that he
was made for.</p>
<p>V.iii.79 (278,8) great the answer be] <i>Answer</i>, as once in
this play before, is <i>retaliation</i>.</p>
<p>V.iii.87 (278,9) That gave the affront with them] That is, that
turned their faces to the enemy.</p>
<p>V.iv.1 (279,1) You shall not now be stolen, you have locks upon
you;/So, graze, as you find pasture] This wit of the gaoler alludes
to the custom of putting a lock on a horse's leg, when he is turned
to pasture.</p>
<p>V.iv.27 (280,3) If you will take this audit, take this life,/And
cancel those cold bonds] This equivocal use of <i>bonds</i> is
another instance of our author's infelicity in pathetic
speeches.</p>
<p>V.iv.45 (281,5) That from me my Posthumus ript] The old copy
reads,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>That from me <i>was</i> Posthumus ript.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Perhaps we should read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>That from <i>my womb</i> Posthumus ript,</p>
<p class="i4">Came crying 'mongst his foes.</p>
</div>

<p>The action of my life is like it]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The meaning, which is too thin to be easily caught, I take to be
this: <i>This is a dream or madness, or both&mdash;or
nothing&mdash;but whether it be a speech without consciousness</i>,
as in a dream, <i>or a speech unintelligible</i>, as in madness, be

<p>V.v.120 (292,4) One sand another/Not more resembles. That sweet

Such marks of the chamber and pictures, as <i>averred</i> or

see whether you will repeat it.</p>
<p>V.v.308 (300,3) By tasting of our wrath] [W: hasting] There is

<p>(307) General Observation. This play has many just sentiments,
some natural dialogues, and some pleasing scenes, but they are
obtained at the expence of much incongruity. To remark the folly of
the fiction, the absurdity of the conduct, the confusion of the
names, and manners of different times, and the impossibility of the
events in any system of life, were to waste criticism upon
unresisting imbecility, upon faults too evident for detection, and
too gross for aggravation.</p>
<h2>KING LEAR</h2>
<p>I.i.4 (311,2) in the division of the kingdom] There is something
of obscurity or inaccuracy in this preparatory scene. The king has
already divided his kingdom, and yet when he enters he examines his
daughters, to discover in what proportions he should divide it.
Perhaps Kent and Gloucester only were privy to his design, which he
still kept in his own hands, to be changed or performed as
subsequent reasons should determine him.</p>
<p>I.i.37 (313,7) express our darker purpose] [<i>Darker</i>, for
more secret; not for indirect, oblique. WARBURTON.] This word may
admit a further explication. <i>We shall express our darker
purpose</i>: that is, we have already made known in some measure
our design of parting the kingdom; we will now discover what has
not been told before, the reasons by which we shall regulate the
partition. This interpretation will justify or palliate the
exordial dialogue.</p>
<p>I.i.39 (313,8) and 'tis our fast intent] [This is an
interpolation of Mr. Lewis Theobald, for want of knowing the
meaning of the old reading in the quarto of 1608, and first folio
of 1623; where we find it,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;and 'tis our <i>first</i> intent.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>WARBURTON.]</p>
<p><i>Fast</i> is the reading of the first folio, and, I think, the
true reading.</p>
<p>I.i.44 (314,9) We have this hour a constant will] <i>constant
will</i> seems a confirmation of <i>fast</i> intent.</p>
<p>I.i.62 (314,2) Beyond all manner of so much I love you] Beyond
all assignable quantity. I love you beyond limits, and cannot say
it is <i>so much</i>, for how much soever I should name, it would
yet be more.</p>
<p>I.i.73 (315,4)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>I find, she names my very deed of love,</p>
<p>Only she comes too short; that I profess]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>That</i> seems to stand without relation, but is referred to
<i>find</i>, the first conjunction being inaccurately suppressed. I
find <i>that</i> she names my deed, I find that I profess,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>I.i.76 (315,5) Which the most precious square of sense
possesses] [Warburton explained "square" as the "four nobler
senses"] This is acute; but perhaps <i>square</i> means only
<i>compass, comprehension</i>.</p>
<p>I.i.80 (315,6) More pond'rous than my tongue] [W: their tongue]
I think the present reading right.</p>
<p>I.i.84 (316,8) Now our joy] Here the true reading is picked out
of two copies. Butter's quarto reads,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>But</i> now our joy,</p>
<p>Although the last, not least in our dear love,</p>
<p>What can you say to win a third, &amp;c.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The folio,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;Now our joy,</p>
<p>Although our last, <i>and</i> least; to whose young love</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>I.i.138 (318,5) The sway, revenue, execution of the rest] [W: of
th' hest] I do not see any great difficulty in the words,
<i>execution of the rest</i>, which are in both the old copies. The
<i>execution of the rest</i> is, I suppose, <i>all the other
business</i>. Dr. Warburton's own explanation of his amendment
confutes it; if <i>hest</i> be a <i>regal comnand</i>, they were,
by the grant of Lear, to have rather the <i>hest</i> than the
execution.</p>
<p>1.1.149 (319,6)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Think'st thou, that duty shall have dread to speak,</p>
<p>When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's bound,</p>
<p>When majesty stoops to folly. Reverse thy doom,</p>
<p>And in thy best consideration check</p>
<p>This hideous rashness: answer my life my judgment,</p>
<p>Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I have given this passage according to the old folio, from which
the modern editions have silently departed, for the sake of better
numbers, with a degree of insincerity, which, if not sometimes
detected and censured, must impair the credit of ancient books. One
of the editors, and perhaps only one, knew how much mischief may be
done by such clandestine alterations. The quarto agrees with the
folio, except that for <i>reserve thy state</i>, it gives,
<i>reverse thy doom</i>, and has <i>stoops</i> instead of <i>falls
to folly</i>. The meaning of <i>answer my life my judgment</i>, is,
<i>Let my life be answerable for my judgment</i>, or, <i>I will
stake my life on my opinion</i>.&mdash;The reading which, without
any right, has possessed all the modern copies is this;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;to plainness honour</p>
<p>Is bound, when majesty to folly falls.</p>
<p>Reserve thy state; with better judgment check</p>
<p>This hideous rashness; with my life I answer,</p>
<p>Thy youngest daughter, &amp;c.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I am inclined to think that <i>reverse thy doom</i> was
Shakespeare's first reading, as more apposite to the present
occasion, and that he changed it afterwards to <i>reserve thy
state</i>, which conduces more to the progress of the action.</p>
<p>I.i.161 (320,9) The true blank of thine eye] The <i>blank</i> is
the <i>white</i> or exact mark at which the arrow is shot. <i>See
better</i>, says Kent, <i>and keep me always in your view</i>.</p>
<p>I.i.172 (320,1) strain'd pride] The oldest copy reads <i>strayed
pride</i>; that is, <i>pride exorbitant</i>; pride passing due
bounds.</p>
<p>I.i.174 (320,3) Which nor our nature, nor our place, can bear;/
Our potency made good] [T: (Which ... bear) ... made good]
[Warburton defended "make"] Theobald only inserted the parenthesis;
he found <i>made good</i> in the best copy of 1623. Dr. Warburton
has very acutely explained and defended the reading that he has
chosen, but I am not certain that he has chosen right. If we take
the reading of the folio, <i>our potency</i> made <i>good</i>, the
sense will be less profound indeed, but less intricate, and equally
commodious. <i>As thou hast come with unreasonable pride between
the</i> sentence <i>which I had passed, and the</i> power <i>by
which I shall execute it</i>, take thy reward <i>in another
sentence which shall</i> make good, <i>shall establish, shall
maintain</i>, that power. If Dr. Warburton's explanation be chosen,
and every reader will wish to choose it, we may better read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Which nor our nature, nor our state can bear,</p>
<p><i>Or</i> potency make good.&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Mr. Davies thinks, that <i>our potency made good</i> relates
only to <i>our place</i>.&mdash;Which our nature cannot bear, nor
our <i>place</i>, without departure from the <i>potency</i> of that
place. This is easy and clear.&mdash;Lear, who is characterized as
hot, heady, and violent, is, with very just observation of life,
made to entangle himself with vows, upon any sudden provocation to
vow revenge, and then to plead the obligation of a vow in defence
of implacability.</p>
<p>I.i.181 (322,4) By Jupiter] Shakespeare makes his Lear too much
a mythologist: he had Hecate and Apollo before.</p>
<p>I.i.190 (322,6) He'll shape his old course] He will follow his
old maxims; he will continue to act upon the same principles.</p>
<p>I.i.201 (323,7) If aught within that little, seeming, substance]
<i>Seeming</i> is <i>beautiful</i>.</p>
<p>I.i.209 (323,9) Election makes not up on such conditions] To
<i>make up</i> signifies to complete, to conclude; as, <i>they made
up the bargain</i>; but in this sense it has, I think, always the
subject noun after it. To <i>make up</i>, in familiar language, is,
neutrally, <i>to come forward</i>, to <i>make advances</i>, which,
I think, is meant here.</p>
<p>I.i.221 (324,2)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Sure her offence</p>
<p>Must be of such unnatural degree,</p>
<p>That monsters it: or your fore-vouch'd affection</p>

</div>
<p>The common books read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;or your fore-vouch'd affection</p>
<p>Fall'n into taint:&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This line has no clear or strong sense, nor is this reading
authorized by any copy, though it has crept into all the late
editions. The early quarto reads,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;or you for vouch'd affections</p>
<p>Fall'n into taint.&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The folio,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;or your fore-vouch'd affection</p>
<p>Fall into taint.&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>Taint</i> is used for <i>corruption</i> and for
<i>disgrace</i>. If therefore we take the oldest reading it may be
reformed thus:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;sure her offence</p>
<p>Must be of such unnatural degree,</p>
<p>That monsters it; or you for vouch'd affection</p>
<p>Fall into taint.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Her offence must be prodigious, or <i>you</i> must <i>fal1 into
reproach</i> for having <i>vouched affection</i> which you did not
feel. If the reading of the folio be preferred, we may with a very
slight change produce the same sense:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;sure her offence</p>
<p>Must be of such unnatural degree,</p>
<p>That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affection</p>
<p><i>Falls</i> into taint.&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>That is, <i>falls into reproach</i> or <i>censure</i>. But there
is another possible sense. <i>Or</i> signifies <i>before</i>, and
<i>or ever</i> is <i>before ever</i>; the meaning in the folio may
therefore be, <i>Sure her crime must be monstrous</i> before
<i>your affection can be affected with hatred</i>. Let the reader
determine.&mdash;As I am not much a friend to conjectural
emendation, I should prefer the latter sense, which requires no
change of reading.</p>
<p>I.i.243 (325,3) from the intire point] <i>Intire</i>, for right,
true. WARB.] Rather, single, unmixed with other considerations.</p>
<p>I.i.264 (326,5) Thou losest here, better where to find]
<i>Here</i> and <i>where</i> have the power of nouns. Thou losest
this residence to find a better residence in another place.</p>
<p>I.i.282 (326,6) And well are worth the want that you have
wanted] [This I take to be the poet's meaning, stript of the jingle
which makes it dark: "You well deserve to meet with that
<i>want</i> of love from your husband, which you have professed to
<i>want</i> for our father." THEOBALD.] [W: have vaunted] I think
the common reading very suitable to the manner of our author, and
well enough explained by Theobald.</p>
<p>I.i.283 (327,7) plaited cunning] i.e. <i>complicated,
involved</i> cunning. (1773)</p>
<p>I.ii.3 (328,2) Stand in the plague of custom] The word
<i>plague</i> is in all the copies; I can scarcely think it right,
nor can I yet reconcile myself to the emendation proposed, though I
have nothing better to offer [Warburton had proposed
<i>plage</i>].</p>
<p>I.ii.21 (330,7) Shall be the legitimate] [Hanmer: toe th']
Hanmer's emendation will appear very plausible to him that shall
consult the original reading. Butter's quarto reads,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;Edmund the base</p>
<p>Shall <i>tooth'</i> legitimate.&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The folio,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;Edmund the base</p>
<p>Shall <i>to th'</i> legitimate.&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Hanmer, therefore, could hardly be charged with coining a word,
though his explanation may be doubted. To <i>toe</i> him, is
perhaps to <i>kick</i> him <i>out</i>, a phrase yet in vulgar use;
or, to <i>toe</i>, may be literally to <i>supplant</i>. The word
<i>be</i> has no authority.</p>
<p>I.ii.24 (331,1) subscrib'd his power!] To subscribe, is, to
transfer by signing or <i>subscribing</i> a writing of testimony.
We now use the term, He <i>subscribed</i> forty pounds to the new
building.</p>
<p>I.ii.25 (331,2) Confin'd to exhibition!] Is <i>allowance</i>.
The term is yet used in the universities.</p>
<p>I.ii.25 (331,3) All this done/Upon the gad!] So the old copies;
the later editions read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;All <i>is gone</i></p>
<p>Upon the gad!&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>which, besides that it is unauthorized, is less proper.
<i>To</i> do upon the <i>gad</i>, is, to act by the sudden
stimulation of caprice, as cattle run madding when they are stung
by the gad fly.</p>
<p>I.ii.47 (332,4) taste of my virtue] Though <i>taste</i> may
stand in this place, yet I believe we should read, <i>assay</i> or
<i>test</i> of my virtue: they are both metallurgical terms, and
properly joined. So in Hamlet,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Bring me to the <i>test</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I.ii.51 (323,6) idle and fond] Weak and foolish.</p>
<p>I.ii.95 (333,7) pretence] <i>Pretence</i> is design, purpose. So
afterwards in this play,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Pretence</i> and purpose of unkindness.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I.ii.106 (333,8) wind me into him] I once thought it should be
read, <i>you</i> into him; but, perhaps, it is a familiar phrase,
like <i>do me this</i>.</p>
<p>I.ii.107 (333,9) I would unstate myself to be in a due
resolution] [i.e. I will throw aside all consideration of my
relation to him, that I may act as justice requires. WARBURTON.]
Such is this learned man's explanation. I take the meaning to be
rather this, <i>Do you frame the business</i>, who can act with
less emotion; <i>I would unstate myself</i>; it would in me be a
departure from the paternal character, <i>to be in a due
resolution</i>, to be settled and composed on such an occasion. The
words <i>would</i> and <i>should</i> are in old language often
confounded.</p>
<p>I.ii.l09 (334,1) convey the business] [<i>Convey</i>, for
introduce. WARB.] To <i>convey</i> is rather to <i>carry
through</i> than to introduce; in this place it is to <i>manage
artfully</i>: we say of a juggler, that he has a clean
<i>conveyance</i>.</p>
<p>I.ii.112 (334,2) These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend
no good to us: tho' the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and
thus, yet nature finds itself scourg'd by the frequent effects]
That is, though natural philosophy can give account of eclipses,
yet we feel their consequences.</p>
<p>I.ii.156 (338,8) I promise you, the effects he writes of,
succeed unhappily] The folio edition commonly differs from the
first quarto, by augmentations or insertions, but in this place it
varies by omission, and by the omission of something which
naturally introduces the following dialogue. It is easy to remark,
that in this speech, which ought, I think, to be inserted as it now
is in the text, Edmund, with the common craft of fortune-tellers,
mingles the past and future, and tells of the future only what he
already foreknows by confederacy, or can attain by probable
conjecture. (see 1765, VI, 27, 6)</p>
<p>I.ii.178 (339,1) that with the mischief of your person it would
scarcely allay] This reading is in both copies; yet I believe the
author gave it, <i>that</i> but <i>with the mischief</i> of your
person it would scarce allay.</p>
<p>I.iii.19 (341,2) Old fools are babes again; and must be us'd/
With checks, as flatteries when they are seen abus'd] These lines
hardly deserve a note, though Mr. Theobald thinks them <i>very
fine</i>. Whether <i>fools</i> or <i>folks</i> should be read is
not worth enquiry. The controverted line is yet in the old quarto,
not as the editors represent it, but thus:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>With checks as flatteries when they are seen abus'd.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I am in doubt whether there is any error of transcription. The
sense seems to be this: <i>Old men must be treated with checks</i>,
when as <i>they are seen to be deceived with flatteries</i>: or,
<i>when they are weak enough to be</i> seen abused by flatteries,
they are then weak enough to be <i>used with checks</i>. There is a
play of the words <i>used</i> and <i>abused</i>. To <i>abuse</i>
is, in our author, very frequently the same as to <i>deceive</i>.
This construction is harsh and ungrammatical; Shakespeare perhaps
thought it vicious, and chose to throw away the lines rather than
correct them, nor would now thank the officiousness of his editors,
who restore what they do not understand.</p>
<p>I.iv.118 (347,5) Would I had two coxcombs, and two daughters]
Two fools caps, intended, as it seems, to mark double folly in the
man that gives all to his daughters.</p>
<p>I.iv.133 (347,7) Lend less than thou owest] That is, <i>do not
lend all that thou hast</i>. To <i>owe</i>, in old English, is
<i>to possess</i>. If <i>owe</i> be taken for <i>to be in debt</i>,
the more prudent precept would be, Lend <i>more</i> than thou
owest.</p>
<p>I.iv.153-170 (348,9) This dialogue, from <i>No, lad; teach
me</i>, down to, <i>Give me an egg</i>, was restored from the first
edition by Mr. Theobald. It is omitted in the folio, perhaps for
political reasons, as it seemed to censure monopolies.</p>
<p>I.iv.181 (349,2) Fools ne'er had less grace in a year] There
never was a time when fools were less in favour; and the reason is,
that they were never so little wanted, for wise men now supply
their place. Such I think is the meaning. The old edition has
<i>wit</i> for <i>grace</i>.</p>
<p>I.iv.219 (350,5) That's a sheal'd peascod] i.e. Now a mere husk,
which contains nothing. The outside of a king remains, but all the
intrinsic parts of royalty are gone: he has nothing to give.
(1773)</p>
<p>I.iv.245 (351,3) Whoop, Jug] There are in the fool's speeches
several passages which seem to be proverbial allusions, perhaps not
now to be understood.</p>
<p>I.iv.256 (352,1) <i>Fool</i>. Which they will make an obedient
father] [This line I have restored from the quarto. STEEVENS] This
note [Tyrwhitt's, quoted by Steevens] is written with confidence
disproportionate to the conviction which it can bring. Lear might
as well know by the marks and tokens arising from sovereignty,
knowledge, and reason, that he had or had not daughters, as he
could know by any thing else. But, says he, if I judge by these
tokens, I find the persuasion false by which I long thought myself
the father of daughters. (1773)</p>
<p>I.iv.302 (355,7) from her derogate body] [<i>Derogate</i> for
<i>unnatural</i>. WARB.] Rather, I think, <i>degraded;
blasted</i>.</p>
<p>I.iv.320 (356,9)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>That these hot tears, which break from me perforce,</p>
<p>Should make thee worth them.&mdash;Blasts and fogs upon

<p>The untented woundings of a father's curse</p>
<p>Pierce every sense about thee!&mdash;Old fond eyes,</p>
<p>Beweep this cause again]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I will transcribe this passage from the first edition, that it
may appear to those who are unacquainted with old books, what is
the difficulty of revision, and what indulgence is due to those
that endeavour to restore corrupted passages.&mdash;<i>That these
hot tears, that breake from me perforce, should make the worst
blasts and fogs upon the untender woundings of a father's curse,
peruse every sense about the old fond eyes, beweep this cause
again, &amp;c.</i></p>
<p>I.iv.362 (358,3) compact it more] Unite one circumstance with
another, so as to make a consistent account.</p>
<p>I.iv.366 (358,4) You are much more at task for want of wisdom]
It is a common phrase now with parents and governesses. <i>I'll
take you to task</i>, i.e. <i>I will reprehend and correct you. To
be at task</i>, therefore, is to be liable to <i>reprehension and
correction</i>. (1773)</p>
<p>I.v.5 (358,1) I shall be there afore you] He seems to intend to
go to his daughter, but it appears afterwards that he is going to
the house of Glo'ster.</p>
<p>I.v.25 (359,2) I did her wrong] He is musing on Cordelia.</p>
<p>I.v.42 (359,3) To take it again perforce!] He is meditating on
the resumption of his royalty.</p>
<p>II.i.9 (360,1) ear-kissing arguments] Subjects of discourse;
topics.</p>
<p>II.i.19 (361,2) queazy question] Something of a <i>suspicious,
questionable, and uncertain nature</i>. This is, I think, the
meaning.</p>
<p>II.i.27 (361,4) have you nothing said/Upon his party 'gainst the
duke of Albany?] I cannot but think the line corrupted, and would
read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Against</i> his party, <i>for</i> the duke of Albany?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>II.i.57 (363,7) gasted] Frighted.</p>
<p>II.i.59 (363,8) Not in this land shall he remain uncaught;/And
found&mdash;Dispatch] [Not in this land shall he remain uncaught;
And found dispatch&mdash;the noble duke, &amp;c.]</p>
<p>[W: found, dispatch'd.] I do not see how this change mends the
sense: I think it may be better regulated as in the page above. The
sense is interrupted. He shall be caught&mdash;and found, <i>he
shall be punished</i>. Dispatch.</p>
<p>II.i.67 (363,2) And found him pight to do it, with curst speech]
<i>Pight</i> is <i>pitched</i>, fixed, settled. <i>Curst</i> is
severe, harsh, vehemently angry.</p>
<p>II.i.122 (366,7) Occasions, noble Glo'ster, of some prize] [W:
poize] <i>Prize</i>, or <i>price</i>, for value. (1773)</p>
<p>II.i.126 (366,8) from our home] Not at home, but at some other
place.</p>
<p>II.ii.9 (367,1) Lipsbury pinfold] The allusion which seems to be
contained in this line I do not understand. In the violent eruption
of reproaches which bursts from Kent in this dialogue, there are
some epithets which the commentators have left unexpounded, and
which I am not very able to make clear. Of a <i>three-suited
knave</i> I know not the meaning, unless it be that he has
different dresses for different occupations. <i>Lilly-liver'd</i>
is <i>cowardly</i>; <i>white-blooded</i> and <i>white-liver'd</i>
are still in vulgar use. An <i>one-trunk-inheriting slave</i>, I
take to be a wearer of old cast-off cloaths, an inheritor of torn
breeches.</p>
<p>II.ii.36 (368,4) barber-monger] Of this word I do not clearly
see the force.</p>
<p>II.ii.39 (368,5) Vanity the puppet's] Alluding to the mysteries
or allegorical shews, in which vanity, iniquity, and other vices,
were personified.</p>
<p>II.ii.45 (369,6) neat slave] You mere slave, you very slave.</p>
<p>II.ii.69 (369,8) Thou whoreson zed; thou unnecessary letter!] I
do not well understand how a man is reproached by being called
<i>zed</i>, nor how Z is an <i>unnecessary letter</i>. Scarron
compares his deformity to the shape of Z, and it may be a proper
word of insult to a crook-backed man; but why should Gonerill's
steward be crooked, unless the allusion be to his bending or
cringing posture in the presence of his superiors. Perhaps it was
written, <i>thou whoreson</i> C (for cuckold) <i>thou unnecessary
letter</i>. C is a letter unnecessary in our alphabet, one of its
two sounds being represented by S, and one by K. But all the copies
concur in the common reading.</p>
<p>II.ii.87 (371,3) epileptic visage!] The frighted countenance of
a man ready to fall in a fit.</p>
<p>II.ii.103 (372,5) constrains the garb/Quite from his nature]
Forces his <i>outside</i> or his <i>appearance</i> to something
totally <i>different from</i> his natural disposition.</p>
<p>II.ii.109 (372,8) Than twenty silly ducking observants] [W:

it is supported.</p>
<p>II.ii.119 (373,8) though I should win your displeasure to

<p>Good king, that must approve the common saw!</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>That art now to exemplify the common proverb, <i>That out
of</i>, &amp;c. That changest better for worse. Hanmer observes,
that it is a proverbial saying, applied to those who are turned out
of house and home to the open weather. It was perhaps first used of
men dismissed from an hospital, or house of charity, such as was
erected formerly in many places for travellers. Those houses had
names properly enough alluded to by <i>heaven's
benediction</i>.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>I know 'tis from Cordelia;</p>
<p>Who hath most fortunately been inform'd</p>
<p>Of my obscur'd coarse, and shall find time</p>
<p>From this enormous state, seeking to give</p>
<p>Losses their remedies]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This passage, which some of the editors have degraded, as
spurious, to the margin, and others have silently altered, I have
faithfully printed according to the quarto, from which the folio
differs only in punctuation. The passage is very obscure, if not
corrupt. Perhaps it may be read thus:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;Cordelia&mdash;has been&mdash;informed.</p>
<p>Of my obscur'd course, and shall find time</p>
<p>From this enormous state-seeking, to give</p>
<p>Losses their remedies.&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Cordelia is informed of our affairs, and when the
<i>enormous</i> care of <i>seeking her fortune</i> will allow her
time, she will employ it in remedying losses. This is harsh;
perhaps something better may be found. I have at least supplied the
genuine reading of the old copies. <i>Enormous</i> is unwonted, out
of rule, out of the ordinary course of things.</p>
<p>II.iii.18 (377,2) Poor pelting villages] <i>Pelting</i> is, I
believe, only an accidental depravation of <i>petty</i>.
Shakespeare uses it in the <i>Midsummer-Night's Dream</i> of
<i>small brooks</i>.</p>
<p>II.iii.20 (378,3) Poor Turlygood! poor Tom!] [W: Turlupin]
Hanmer reads, <i>poor</i> Turlurd. It is probable the word
<i>Turlygood</i> was the common corrupt pronunciation.</p>
<p>II.iii.21 (378,4) Edgar I nothing am] As Edgar I am out-lawed,
dead in law; I have no longer any political existence.</p>
<p>II.iv (378,1) <i>Changes again to the earl of Glo'ster's
castle</i>] It is not very clearly discovered why Lear comes
hither. In the foregoing part he sent a letter to Glo'ster; but no
hint is given of its contents. He seems to have gone to visit
Glo'ster while Cornwall and Regan might prepare to entertain
him.</p>
<p>II.iv.24 (380,4) To do upon respect such violent outrage] To
violate the public and venerable character of a messenger from the
king.</p>
<p>II.iv.46 (380,7) Winter's not gone yet, if the wild geese fly
that way] If this be their behaviour, the king's troubles are not
yet at an end.</p>
<p>II.iv.70 (381,9) All that follow their noses are led by their
eyes, but blind men; and there's not a nose among twenty, but can
smell him that's stinking] There is in this sentence no clear
series of thought. If he that follows his nose is led or guided by
his eyes, he wants no information from his nose. I persuade myself,
but know not whether I can persuade others, that our author wrote
thus:&mdash;"All men are led by their eyes, but blind men, and they
follow their noses; and there's not a nose among twenty but can
smell him that's stinking."&mdash;Here is a succession of
reasoning. You ask, why the king has no more in his train? why,
because men who are led by their eyes see that he is ruined; and if
there were any blind among them, who, for want of eyes, followed
their noses, they might by their noses discover that it was no
longer fit to follow the king.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>I think this passage erroneous, though both the copies concur.
The sense mill be mended if we read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>But I will tarry; the fool will stay,</p>
<p>And let the wise man fly;</p>
<p>The fool turns knave, that runs away;</p>
<p>The knave no fool,&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>That I stay with the king is a proof that I am a fool, the wise
men are deserting him. There is knavery in this desertion, but
there is no folly.</p>
<p>II.iv.116 (383,3) Is practice only] <i>Practice</i> is in
Shakespeare, and other old writers, used commonly in an ill sense
for <i>unlawful artifice</i>.</p>
<p>II.iv.122 (384,4) Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the
eels, when she put them i' the paste alive] Hinting that the eel
and Lear are in the same danger.</p>
<p>II.iv.142 (384,7) Than she to scant her duty] The word
<i>scant</i> is directly contrary to the sense intended. The quarto
reads,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>slack</i> her duty,</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>which is no better. May we not change it thus:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>You less know bow to value her desert,</p>
<p>Than she to <i>scan</i> her duty.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>To <i>scan</i> may be to <i>measure</i> or <i>proportion</i>.
Yet our author uses his negatives with such licentiousness, that it
is hardly safe to make any alteration.&mdash;<i>Scant</i> may mean
to <i>adapt</i>, to <i>fit</i>, to <i>proportion</i>; which sense
seems still to be retained in the mechanical term scantling. (see
1765, VI, 67, 4)</p>
<p>II.iv.155 (385,1) Do you but mark how this becomes the house?]
[T: the use?] [Warburton called "becomes the house" "a most
expressive phrase"] with this <i>most expressive phrase</i> I
believe no reader is satisfied. I suspect that it has been written
originally,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Ask her forgiveness?</p>
<p>Do you but mark how this becometh&mdash;thus.</p>
<p>Dear daughter, I confess, &amp;c.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>Becomes the house</i>, and <i>becometh thus</i>, might be
easily confounded by readers so unskilful as the original
printers.</p>
<p>II.iv.157 (386,2) <i>Age is unnecessary</i>] i.e. Old age has
few wants.</p>
<p>II.iv.162 (386,3) Look'd black upon me] To <i>look black</i>,
may easily be explained to <i>look cloudy</i> or <i>gloomy</i>. See
Milton:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"So frown'd the mighty combatants, that hell</p>
<p>Grew darker at their frown."&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>II.iv.170 (386,4) To fall, and blast her pride!] Thus the
quarto: the folio reads not so well, <i>to fall and blister</i>. I
think there is still a fault, which may be easily mended by
changing a letter:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;Infect her beauty,</p>
<p>Ye fen-suck'd fogs, drawn by the powerful sun,</p>
<p><i>Do</i>, fall, and blast her pride!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>II.iv.174 (387.6) Thy tender-hested nature shall not give/Thee
o'er to harshness] This word, though its general meaning be plain,
I do not critically understand.</p>
<p>II.iv.178 (387,7) to scant my sizes] To contract my allowances
or proportions settled.</p>
<p>II.iv.203 (388,9) much less advancement] The word
<i>advancement</i> is ironically used here for
<i>conspicuousness</i> of punishment; as we now say, <i>a man is
advanced to the pillory</i>. We should read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;but his own disorders</p>
<p>Deserv'd much <i>more</i> advancement.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>II.iv.204 (388,1) I pray you, father, being weak, seem so] [W:

think yourself weak. No change is needed.</p>
<p>II.iv.218 (389,3) base life] i.e. In a <i>servile</i> state.</p>
<p>II.iv.227 (390,5) embossed carbuncle] <i>Embossed</i> is
<i>swelling, protuberant</i>.</p>
<p>II.iv.259 (391,6) Those wicked creatures yet do look
well-favour'd:/ When others are more wicked] Dr. Warburton would
exchange the repeated epithet <i>wicked</i> into <i>wrinkled</i> in
both places. The commentator's only objection to the lines as they
now stand, is the discrepancy of the metaphor, the want of
opposition between <i>wicked</i> and <i>well-favoured</i>. But he
might have remembered what he says in his own preface concerning
<i>mixed modes</i>. Shakespeare, whose mind was more intent upon
notions than words, had in his thoughts the pulchritude of virtue,
and the deformity of wickedness; and though he had mentioned
<i>wickedness</i>, made the correlative answer to
<i>deformity</i>.</p>
<p>III.i.7 (394,1) That things might change, or cease: tears his
white hair] The first folio ends the speech at <i>change, or
cease</i>, and begins again with Kent's question, <i>But who is
with him?</i> The whole speech is forcible, but too long for the
occasion, and properly retrenched.</p>
<p>III.i.18 (395,3) my note] My observation of your character.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The true state of this speech cannot from all these notes be
discovered. As it now stands it is collected from two editions: the
lines which I have distinguished by Italics are found in the folio,
not in the quarto; the following lines inclosed in crotchets are in
the quarto, not in the folio. So that if the speech be read with
omissions of the Italics, it will stand according to the first
edition; and if the Italics are read, and the lines that follow
them omitted, it will then stand according to the second. The
speech is now tedious, because it is formed by a coalition of both.
The second edition is generally best, and was probably nearest to
Shakespeare's last copy, but in this passage the first is
preferable; for in the folio, the messenger is sent, he knows not
why, he knows not whither. I suppose Shakespeare thought his plot
opened rather too early, and made the alteration to veil the event
from the audience; but trusting too much to himself, and full of a
single purpose, he did not accommodate his new lines to the rest of
the scene.&mdash;The learned critic's [Warburton] emendations are
now to be examined. <i>Scattered</i> he has changed to
<i>scathed</i>; for <i>scattered</i>, he says, gives <i>the idea of
an anarchy, which was not the case</i>. It may be replied that
<i>scathed</i> gives the idea of ruin, waste, and desolation,
<i>which was not the case</i>. It is unworthy a lover of truth, in
questions of great or little moment, to exaggerate or extenuate for
mere convenience, or for vanity yet less than convenience.
<i>Scattered</i> naturally means <i>divided, unsettled,
disunited</i>.&mdash;Next is offered with great pomp a change of
<i>sea</i> to <i>seize</i>; but in the first edition the word is
<i>fee</i>, for <i>hire</i>, in the sense of having any one in
<i>fee</i>, that is, at <i>devotion for money</i>. <i>Fee</i> is in
the second quarto changed to <i>see</i>, from which one made
<i>sea</i> and another <i>seize</i>.</p>
<p>III.ii.4 (398,1) thought-executing] Doing execution with
rapidity equal to thought.</p>
<p>III.ii.19 (399,4) Here I stand, your slave] [W: brave] The
meaning is plain enough, he was not their <i>slave</i> by right or
compact, but by necessity and compulsion. Why should a passage be
darkened for the sake of changing it? Besides, of <i>brave</i> in
that sense I remember no example.</p>
<p>III.ii.24 (399,5) 'tis foul] Shameful; dishonourable.</p>
<p>III.ii.30 (399,6) So beggars marry many] i.e. A beggar marries a
wife and lice.</p>
<p>III.ii.46 (400,1) Man's nature cannot carry/The affliction, nor
the fear] So the folio: the later editions read, with the quarto,
<i>force</i> for <i>fear</i>, less elegantly.</p>
<p>III.ii.56 (401,3) That under covert and convenient seeming]
<i>Convenient</i> needs not be understood in any other than its
usual and proper sense; <i>accommodate</i> to the present purpose;
<i>suitable</i> to a design. <i>Convenient seeming</i> is
<i>appearance</i> such as may promote his purpose to destroy.</p>
<p>III.ii.53 (401,4) concealing continents] <i>Continent</i> stands
for that which <i>contains</i> or <i>incloses</i>.</p>
<p>III.ii.72 (401,(5) Poor fool and knave, I have one part in my
heart,/ That's sorry yet for thee] Some editions read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>thing</i> in my heart;</p>

</div>
<p>from which Hanmer, and Dr. Warburton after him, have made

<p><i>Though the rain it raineth every day</i>]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I fancy that the second line of this stanza had once a
termination that rhymed with the fourth; but I can only fancy it;
for both the copies agree. It was once perhaps written,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>With heigh ho, the wind and the rain <i>in his way</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The meaning seems likewise to require this insertion. "He that
has wit, however small, and finds wind and rain in his way, must
content himself by thinking, that somewhere or other <i>it raineth
every day</i>, and others are therefore suffering like himself."
Yet I am afraid that all this is chimerical, for the burthen
appears again in the song at the end of <i>Twelfth Night</i>, and
seems to have been an arbitrary supplement, without any reference
to the sense of the song. (see 1765, VI, 84, 6)</p>
<p>III.ii.80 (402,8) I'll speak a prophecy ere I go] [W: or two
ere] The sagacity and acuteness of Dr. Warburton are very
conspicuous in this note. He has disentangled the confusion of the
passage, and I have inserted his emendation in the text. <i>Or
e'er</i> is proved by Mr. Upton to be good English, but the
controversy was not necessary, for <i>or</i> is not in the old
copies. [Steevens retained "ere"]</p>
<p>III.ii.84 (403,1) No heretics burnt, but wenches' suitors] The
disease to which <i>wenches' suitors</i> are particularly exposed,
was called in Shakespeare's time the <i>brenning</i> or
<i>burning</i>.</p>

</div>
<div class="stanza"></div>
</div>
<p>These two lines were added in the author's revision, and are
only in the folio. They are very judiciously intended to represent
that humility, or tenderness, or neglect of forms, which affliction
forces on the mind.</p>
<p>III.iv.52 (407,3) led through fire and through flame] Alluding
to the <i>ignis fatuus</i>, supposed to be lights kindled by
mischievous beings to lead travellers into destruction.</p>
<p>III.iv.54 (407,4) laid knives under his pillow] He recounts the
temptations by which he was prompted to suicide; the opportunities
of destroying himself, which often occurred to him in his
melancholy moods.</p>
<p>III.iv.60 (407,5) Bless thee from whirlwinds, star-blasting, and

merely <i>credulous</i>, but <i>credulous of evil</i>, ready to
receive malicious reports. (1773)</p>
<p>III.iv.103 (409,1) says suum, mun, ha no nonny, dolphin my boy,
boy, Sessy: let him trot by] Of this passage I can make nothing. I
believe it corrupt: for wildness, not nonsense, is the effect of a
disordered imagination. The quarto reads, <i>hay no on ny,
dolphins, my boy, cease, let him trot by</i>. Of interpreting this
there is not much hope or much need. But any thing may be tried.
The madman, now counterfeiting a proud fit, supposes himself met on
the road by some one that disputes the way, and cries
<i>Hey!&mdash;No</i>&mdash;but altering his mind, condescends to
let him pass, and calls to his boy <i>Dolphin</i> (Rodolph) not to
contend with him. <i>On&mdash;Dolphin, my boy, cease. Let him trot
by</i>.</p>

</div>
<p>In the old quarto the corruption is such as may deserve to be
noted. "Swithold footed thrice the old another night moore and her
nine fold bid her, O light, and her troth plight, and arint thee,
with arint thee."</p>
<p>III.iv.144 (412,6) <i>small deer</i>] Sir Thomas Hanmer reads
<i>geer</i>, and is followed by Dr. Warburton. But <i>deer</i> in
old language is a general word for wild animals.</p>
<p>III.iv.187 (414,8) <i>Child Rowland</i>] This word is in some of
our ballads. There is a song of <i>Child Walter, and a
Lady</i>.</p>
<p>III.v.21 (415,2) If I find him comforting the king] He uses the
word in the juridical sense for <i>supporting, helping</i>,
according to its derivation; <i>salvia</i> comfortat <i>ne
vos</i>.&mdash;<i>Schol. Sal.</i> (rev. 1778, IX, 477, 3)</p>
<p>III.vi.20 (416,2) a horse's health] [W: heels] Shakespeare is
here speaking not of things maliciously treacherous, but of things
uncertain and not durable, A horse is above all other animals
subject to diseases.</p>
<p>III.vi.26 (416,3) Wantest thou eyes at trial, madam?] It may be
observed that Edgar, being supposed to be found by chance, and
therefore to have no knowledge of the rest, connects not his ideas
with those of Lear, but pursues his own train of delirious or
fantastic thought. To these words, <i>At trial, madam?</i> I think
therefore that the name of Lear should be put. The process of the
dialogue will support this conjecture. (1773)</p>
<p>III.vi.27 (417,4) <i>Come oe'er the broom, Bessy, to me</i>] As
there is no relation between <i>broom</i> and a <i>boat</i>, we may
better read,</p>
<div class="poem">

<p>Come o'er the <i>brook</i>, Bessy, to me.</p>

<p><i>Sleepest, or wakest thou, jolly shepherd?</i></p>
<p><i>Thy sheep be in the corn;</i></p>
<p>And for one blast of thy minikin mouth,</p>
<p>Thy sheep shall take no harm.]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This seems to be a stanza of some pastoral song. A shepherd is
desired to pipe, and the request is enforced by a promise, that
though his sheep be in the corn, i.e. committing a trespass by his
negligence, implied in the question, <i>Sleepest thou or
wakest?</i> Yet a single tune upon his pipe shall secure them from
the pound. (1773)</p>
<p>III.vi.77 (419,8) Sessy, come] Here is <i>sessey</i> again,
which I take to be the French word <i>cessez</i> pronounced
<i>cessey</i>, which was, I suppose, like some others in common use
among us. It is an interjection enforcing cessation of any action,
like, <i>be quiet, have done</i>. It seems to have been gradually
corrupted into, <i>so, so</i>.</p>
<p>III.vi.78 (419,9) thy horn is dry] Men that begged under
pretence of lunacy used formerly to carry a horn, and blow it
through the streets.</p>
<p>III.vi.103-121 (420,2) [<i>Kent.</i> Opprest nature sleeps] The
lines inserted from the quarto are in crotchets. The omission of
them in the folio is certainly faulty: yet I believe the folio is
printed from Shakespeare'a last revision, carelessly and hastily
performed, with more thought of shortening the scenes, than of
continuing the action.</p>
<p>III.vi.111 (421,4) free things] States clear from distress.</p>

<p>III.vii.99-107 (426,3) I'll never care what wickedness I do]
[This short dialogue I have inserted from the old quarto, because I
think it full of nature. Servants could hardly see such a barbarity
committed on their master, without pity; and the vengeance that
they presume canst overtake the actors of it is a sentiment and
doctrine well worthy of the stage. THEOBALD.] It is not necessary
to suppose them the servants of Glo'ster; for Cornwall was opposed
to extremity by his own servant.</p>
<p>IV.i.1 (427,1) Yet better thus, and known to be contemn'd] The
meaning is, <i>'Tis better</i> to be <i>thus contemned, and</i>
known <i>to yourself</i> to be contemned. Or perhaps there is an
error, which may be rectified thus:</p>
<div class="poem">

<p>When a man divests himself of his real character he feels no
pain from contempt, because he supposes it incurred only by a
voluntary disguise which he can throw off at pleasure. I do not
think any correction necessary.</p>
<p>IV.i.20 (429,3) Our mean secures us] [i.e. Moderate, mediocre
condition. WARBURTON.] Banner writes, by an easy change,
<i>meanness</i> secures us. The two original editions have,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Our <i>meanes</i> secures us.&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I do not remember that <i>mean</i> is ever used aa a substantive
for low fortune, which is the sense here required, nor for
mediocrity, except in the phrase, the <i>golden mean</i>. I suspect
the passage of corruption, and would either read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Our means <i>seduce</i> us:&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Our powers of body or fortune draw us into evils. Or,</p>
<div class="poem">

<p>Our <i>maims</i> secure us.&mdash;</p>

</div>
<p>That hurt or deprivation which makes us defenceless, proves our
safeguard. This is very proper in Glo'ster, newly maimed by the
evulsion of his eyes.</p>
<p>IV.i.59-64 (431,8) [Five fiends have been in poor Tom at once;
of lust, as <i>Obidicut</i>; <i>Hobbididance</i>, prince of
dumbness; <i>Mahu</i>, of stealing; <i>Modo</i>, of murder; and
<i>Flibbertigibbet</i>, of mopping and mowing; who since possesses
chamber-maids and waiting-women. So bless thee, master!]] The
passage in crotchets is omitted in the folio, because I suppose as
the story was forgotten, the jest was lost.</p>
<p>IV.i.68 (432,1) Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man] Lear
has before uttered the same sentiment, which indeed cannot be too
strongly impressed, tho' it may be too often repeated.</p>
<p>IV.i.69 (432,2) That slaves your ordinance] [W: braves] The
emendation is plausible, yet I doubt whether it be right. The
language of Shakespeare is very licentious, and his words have
often meanings remote from the proper and original use. To
<i>slave</i> or <i>beslave</i> another is to <i>treat</i> him
<i>with terms of indignity</i>; in a kindred sense, to <i>slave the
ordinance</i>, may be, to <i>slight</i> or <i>ridicule</i> it.</p>
<p>IV.ii.1 (433,1) our mild husband] It must be remembered that
Albany, the husband of Gonerill, disliked, in the end of the first
act, the scheme of oppression and ingratitude.</p>
<p>IV.ii.29 (434,5) I have been worth the whistle] This expression
is a reproach to Albany for having neglected her; <i>though you
disregard me thus</i>, I have been worth the whistle, <i>I have
found one that thinks me worth calling</i>. (1773)</p>
<p>IV.ii.35 (435,9) From her maternal sap] [W: material] I suppose
no reader doubts but the word should be <i>maternal</i>. Dr.
Warburton has taken great pains without much success, and indeed
without much exactness of attention, to prove that <i>material</i>
has a more proper sense than <i>maternal</i>, and yet seemed glad
at last to infer from an apparent error of another press that
<i>material</i> and <i>maternal</i> meant the same.</p>
<p>IV.ii.45 (436,2) A man, a prince by him so benefited?] [After
this line I suspect a line or two to be wanting, which upbraids her
for her sister's cruelty to Glo'ster. WARBURTON.] Here is a pompous
note to support a conjecture apparently erroneous, and confuted by
the next scene, in which the account is given for the first time to
Albany of Glo'ster's sufferings.</p>
<p>IV.ii.50 (436,3) Like monsters of the deep] Fishes are the only
animals that are known to prey upon their own species.</p>
<p>IV.ii.62 (437,5) Thou changed, and self-cover'd thing] Of these
lines there is but one copy, and the editors are forced open
conjecture. They have published this line thus;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Thou chang'd, and <i>self-converted</i> thing;</p>
</div>

meant, thou that hast <i>disguised</i> nature by wickedness; thou
that hast <i>hid</i> the woman under the fiend.</p>
<p>IV.ii.83 (438,6) One way, I like this well] Gonerill is well
pleased that Cornwall is destroyed, who was preparing war against
her and her husband, but is afraid of losing Edmund to the
widow.</p>
<p>IV.iii (439,1) <i>The French camp, near Dover. Enter Kent, and a
Gentleman</i>] This scene seems to have been left out only to
shorten the play, and is necessary to continue the action. It is
extant only in the quarto, being omitted in the first folio. I have
therefore put it between crotchets.</p>
<p>IV.iii (439,2) <i>a Gentleman</i>] The gentleman whom he sent in
the foregoing act with letters to Cordelia.</p>
<p>IV.iii.26 (440,4) Made she no verbal question?] I do not see the
impropriety of <i>verbal question</i>; such pleonasms are common.
So we say, <i>my ears have heard, my eyes have beheld</i>. Besides,
where is the word <i>quest</i> [Warburton's emendation] to be
found?</p>
<p>IV.iii.33 (440,6) And clamour-moisten'd] <i>Clamour moisten'd
her</i>; that is, <i>her out-cries were accompanied with
tears</i>.</p>
<p>IV.iii.36 (441,7) one self-mate and mate] The same husband and
the same wife.</p>
<p>IV.iii.51 (441,9) 'Tis so they are a-foot] Dr. Warburton thinks
it necessary to read, <i>'tis said</i>; but the sense is plain,
<i>So it is</i> that <i>they are on foot</i>.</p>
<p>IV.iv.4 (442,1) With bur-docks, hemlock] I do not remember any
such plant as a <i>hardock</i>, but one of the most common weeds is
a <i>burdock</i>, which I believe should be read here; and so
Hanmer reads.</p>
<p>IV.iv.20 (443,2) the means to lead it] The reason which should
guide it.</p>
<p>IV.iv.26 (443,3) My mourning and important tears hath pitied] In
other places of this author for <i>importunate</i>.</p>
<p>IV.iv.27 (443,4) No blown embition] No inflated, no swelling
pride. Beza on the Spanish Armada:</p>

<p>IV.v.4 (444,1) <i>Reg.</i> Lord Edmund spake not with your lady

and better reading.</p>
<p>IV.v.22 (444,3) Let me unseal the letter./<i>Stew.</i> Madam, I
had rather] I know not well why Shakespeare gives the steward, who
is a mere factor of wickedness, so much fidelity. He now refuses
the letter; and afterwards, when he is dying, thinks only how it
may be safely delivered.</p>
<p>IV.v.29 (445,5) I do advise you, take this note] <i>Note</i>
means in this place not a <i>letter</i> but a <i>remark</i>.
Therefore <i>observe</i> what I am saying.</p>
<p>IV.v.32 (446,6) You may gather more] You may infer more than I
have directly told you.</p>
<p>IV.vi (446,1) <i>The country near Dover. Enter Glo'ster, and
Edgar as a peasant</i>] This scene, and the stratagem by which
Glo'ster is cured of his desperation, are wholly borrowed from
Sidney's <i>Arcadia</i>.</p>
<p>IV.vi.7 (447,2) thy voice is alter'd] Edgar alters his voice in
order to pass afterwards for a malignant spirit.</p>
<p>IV.vi.11 (447,5) How fearful/And dizzy 'tis, to cast one's eyes
so low!] This description has been much admired since the time of
Addison, who has remarked, with a poor attempt at pleasantry, that
"he who can read it without being giddy, has a very good head, or a
very bad one." The description is certainly not mean, but I am far
from thinking it wrought to the utmost excellence of poetry. He
that looks from a precipice finds himself assailed by one great and
dreadful image of irresistible destruction. But this overwhelming
idea is dissipated and enfeebled from the instant that the mind can
restore itself to the observation of particulars, and diffuse its
attention to distinct objects. The enumeration of the choughs and
crows, the samphire-man, and the fishers, counteracts the great
effect of the prospect, as it peoples the desert of intermediate
vacuity, and stops the mind in the rapidity of its descent through
emptiness and horror.</p>
<p>IV.vi.19 (447,4) her cock] Her cock-boat.</p>
<p>IV.vi.43 (448,6) when life itself/Yields to the theft] When life
is willing to be destroyed.</p>
<p>IV.vi.47 (449,7) Thus might he pass, indeed] Thus he might
<i>die</i> in reality. We still use the word <i>passing</i>
bell.</p>
<p>IV.vi.53 (449,9) Ten masts at each make not the altitude] [Pope:
attacht] Mr. Pope's conjecture may stand if the word which he uses
were known in our author's time, but I think it is of later
introduction. He may say,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Ten masts <i>on end</i>&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>IV.vi.57 (449,1) chalky bourn] <i>Bourn</i> seems here to
signify a <i>hill</i>. Its common signification is a <i>brook</i>.
Milton in <i>Comus</i> uses <i>bosky bourn</i> in the same sense
perhaps with Shakespeare. But in both authors it may mean only a
<i>boundary</i>.</p>
<p>IV.vi.73 (450,2) the clearest gods] The purest; the most free
from evil.</p>
<p>IV.vi.80 (450,3) Bear free and patient thoughts] To be
melancholy is to have the mind <i>chained down</i> to one painful
idea; there is therefore great propriety in exhorting Glo'ster to
<i>free thoughts</i>, to an emancipation of his soul from grief and
despair.</p>
<p>IV.vi.81 (450,4) The safer sense will ne'er accommodate/His

<p>IV.vi.87 (451,5) That fellow handles his bow like a crow-keeper]
This <i>crow-keeper</i> was so common in the author's time, that it
is one of the few peculiarities mentioned by Ortelius in his
account of our island.</p>
<p>IV.vi.93 (451,8) Give the word] Lear supposes himself in a
garrison, and before he lets Edgar pass, requires the
watch-word.</p>
<p>IV.vi.97 (452,7) Ha! Gonerill!&mdash;with a white beard!] So
reads the folio, properly; the quarto, whom the later editors have
followed, has, <i>Ha! Gonerill, ha! Regan! they flattered me</i>,
&amp;c. which is not so forcible.</p>
<p>IV.vi.98 (452,8) They flattered me like a dog] They played the
spaniel to me.</p>
<p>IV.vi.121 (453,2) Whose face between her forks] I believe that
the <i>forks</i> were two prominences of the ruff rising on each
side of the face.</p>
<p>IV.vi.124 (453,4) nor the soyled horse] <i>Soiled</i> horse is
probably the same as <i>pampered</i> horse, <i>un cheval
so&ucirc;l&eacute;</i>.</p>
<p>IV.vi.169 (454.5) Robes and furr'd gowns hide all] From <i>hide
all</i> to <i>accuser's lips</i>, the whole passage is wanting in
the first edition, being added, I suppose, at his revisal.</p>
<p>IV.vi.187 (455,8) This a good block!] I do not see how this
<i>block</i> corresponds either with his foregoing or following
train of thoughts. Madmen think not wholly at random. I would read
thus, <i>a good flock</i>. <i>Flocks</i> are wool moulded together.
The sentence then follows properly:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>It were a delicate stratagem to shoe</p>
<p>A troop of horse with felt;&mdash;</p>

sometimes used in former ages, for it is mentioned in

<p>"&mdash;Fece nel cader strepito quanto</p>
<p>Avesse avuto sotto i piedi il <i>feltro</i>."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It is very common for madmen to catch an accidental hint, and
strain it to the purpose predominant in their minds. Lear picks up
a <i>flock</i>, and immediately thinks to surprize his enemies by a
troop of horse shod with <i>flocks</i> or <i>felt</i>. Yet
<i>block</i> may stand, if we suppose that the sight of a block put
him in mind of mounting his horse.</p>
<p>IV.vi.199 (457,1) Why, this would make a man, a man of salt]
Would make a man melt away like salt in wet weather.</p>
<p>IV.vi.206 (457,2) Then there's life in't] The case is not yet
desperate.</p>
<p>IV.vi.217 (457,3) the main descry/Stands on the hourly thought]
The <i>main</i> body is <i>expected</i> to be <i>descry'd</i> every

Staffordshire, to <i>rake</i> the fire, is to cover it with fuel
for the night.</p>
<p>IV.vi.234 (460,4) the death-practis'd duke] The duke of Albany,
whose death is machinated by <i>practice</i> or treason.</p>
<p>IV.vii.3 (461,1) every measure fail me] All good which I shall
allot thee, or <i>measure out</i> to thee, will be scanty.</p>
<p>IV.vii.9 (461,4) shortens my made intent] [W: laid] An intent

language, to <i>make a design</i>, and to <i>make a
resolution</i>.</p>
<p>IV.vii.41 (464,2) 'Tis wonder, that thy life and wits, at

sense of the French word <i>partie</i>, in <i>prendre partie, to
take his resolution</i>.</p>
<p>V.i.68 (471,9) for my state/Stands on me to defend, not to

word of inference or causality. The meaning is rather: <i>Such is
my determination concerning Lear</i>; <i>as</i> for my state <i>it
requires now, not</i> deliberation, <i>but</i> defence <i>and

<p>(488) General Observation. The tragedy of Lear is deservedly
celebrated among the dramas of Shakespeare. There is perhaps no
play which keeps the attention so strongly fixed; which so much
agitates our passions and interests our curiosity. The artful
involutions of distinct interests, the striking opposition of
contrary characters, the sudden changes of fortune, and the quick
succession of events, fill the mind with a perpetual tumult of
indignation, pity, and hope. There is no scene which does not
contribute to the aggravation of the distress or conduct of the
action, and scarce a line which does not conduce to the progress of
the scene. So powerful is the current of the poet's imagination,
that the mind, which once ventures within it, is hurried
irresistibly along.</p>
<p>On the seeming improbability of Lear's conduct it may be
observed, that he is represented according to histories at that
time vulgarly received as true. And, perhaps, if we turn our
thoughts upon the barbarity and ignorance of the age to which this
story is referred, it will appear not so unlikely as while we
estimate Lear's manners by our own. Such preference of one daughter
to another, or resignation of dominion on such conditions, would be
yet credible, if told of a petty prince of Guinea or Madagascar.
Shakespeare, indeed, by the mention of his earls and dukes, has
given us the idea of times more civilized, and of life regulated by
softer manners; and the truth is, that though he so nicely
discriminates, and so minutely describes the characters of men, he
commonly neglects and confounds the characters of ages, by mingling
customs ancient and modern, English and foreign.</p>
<p>My learned friend Mr. Warton, who has in the <i>Adventurer</i>
very minutely criticised this play, remarks, that the instances of
cruelty are too savage and shocking, and that the intervention of
Edmund destroys the simplicity of the story. These objections may,
I think, be answered, by repeating, that the cruelty of the
daughters is an historical fact, to which the poet has added
little, having only drawn it into a series by dialogue and action.
But I am not able to apologize with equal plausibility for the
extrusion of Glo'ster's eyes, which seems an act too horrid to be
endured in dramatic exhibition, and such as must always compel the
mind to relieve its distress by incredulity. Yet let it be
remembered that our author well knew what would please the audience
for which he wrote.</p>
<p>The injury done by Edmund to the simplicity of the action is
abundantly recompensed by the addition of variety, by the art with
which he is made to co-operate with the chief design, and the
opportunity which he gives the poet of combining perfidy with
perfidy, and connecting the wicked son with the wicked daughters,
to impress this important moral, that villainy is never at a stop,
that crimes lead to crimes, and at last terminate in ruin.</p>
<p>But though this moral be incidentally enforced, Shakespeare has
suffered the virtue of Cordelia to perish in a just cause, contrary
to the natural ideas of justice, to the hope of the reader, and,
what is yet more strange, to the faith of chronicles. Yet this
conduct is justified by <i>The Spectator</i>, who blames Tate for
giving Cordelia success and happiness in his alteration, and
declares, that, in his opinion, <i>the tragedy has lost half its
beauty</i>. Dennis has remarked, whether justly or not, that, to
secure the favourable reception of <i>Cato, the town was poisoned
with much false and abominable criticism</i>, and that endeavours
had been used to discredit and decry poetical justice. A play in
which the wicked prosper, and the virtuous miscarry, may doubtless
be good, because it is a just representation of the common events
of human life: but since all reasonable beings naturally love
justice, I cannot easily be persuaded, that the observation of
justice makes a play worse; or, that if other excellencies are
equal, the audience will not always rise better pleased from the
final triumph of persecuted virtue.</p>
<p>In the present case the public has decided. Cordelia, from the
time of Tate, has always retired with victory and felicity. And, if
my sensations could add any thing to the general suffrage, I night
relate, I was many years ago so shocked by Cordelia's death, that I
know not whether I ever endured to read again the last scenes of
the play till I undertook to revise them as an editor.</p>
<p>There is another controversy among the critics concerning this
play. It is disputed whether the predominant image in Lear's
disordered mind be the loss of his kingdom or the cruelty of his
daughters. Mr. Murphy, a very judicious critic, has evinced by
induction of particular passages, that the cruelty of his daughters
is the primary source of his distress, and that the loss of royalty
affects him only as a secondary and subordinate evil. He observes
with great justness, that Lear would move our compassion but
little, did we not rather consider the injured father than the
degraded king.</p>
<p>The story of this play, except the episode of Edmund, which is
derived, I think, from Sidney, is taken originally from Geoffry of
Monmouth, whom Hollinshed generally copied; but perhaps immediately
from an old historical ballad. My reason for believing that the
play was posterior to the ballad, rather than the ballad to the
play, is, that the ballad has nothing of Shakespeare's nocturnal
tempest, which is too striking to have been omitted, and that it
follows the chronicle; it has the rudiments of the play, but none
of its amplifications: it first hinted Lear's madness, but did not
array it in circumstances. The writer of the ballad added something
to the history, which is a proof that he would have added more, if
more had occurred to his mind, and more must have occurred if he
had seen Shakespeare. [Johnson appends "A lamentable SONG of the
Death of King Leir and his Three Daughters"]</p>

<p>I cannot but suspect that some lines are lost, which connected

uncommon state, as can deserve all this toil of antithesis.</p>
<p>I.i.192 (14,5) Why, such is love's transgression] Such is the
consequence of unskilful and mistaken kindness. (see 1765, VIII,
12, 2)</p>
<p>1.1.198 (14,6) Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes]
The author may mean <i>being purged of smoke</i>, but it is perhaps
a meaning never given to the word in any other place. I would
rather read, <i>Being</i> urged, <i>a fire sparkling</i>. Being
excited and inforced. To <i>urge</i> the fire is the technical
term.</p>
<p>I.i.199 (14,7) Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears]
As this line stands single, it is likely that the foregoing or
following line that rhym'd to it, is lost.</p>
<p>I.i.206 (14,8) Tell me in sadness] That is, tell me
<i>gravely</i>, tell me in <i>seriousness</i>.</p>
<p>I.i.217 (15,1) in strong proof] In chastity <i>of proof</i>, as
we say in armour <i>of proof</i>.</p>
<p>I.i.222 (15,2)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>O, she is rich in beauty; only poor</p>
<p>That when she dies, with beauty dies her store]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Mr. Theobald reads, "<i>With</i> her dies beauties
<i>store</i>;" and is followed by the two succeeding editors. I
have replaced the old reading, because I think it at least as
plausible as the correction. <i>She is rich</i>, says he, <i>in
beauty</i>, and <i>only poor</i> in being subject to the lot of
humanity, that <i>her store</i>, or riches, <i>can be destroyed by
death</i>, who shall, by the same blow, put an end to beauty.</p>
<p>I.ii.15 (17,2) She is the hopeful lady of my earth] <i>The lady
of his earth</i> is an expression not very intelligible, unless he
means that she is heir to his estate, and I suppose no man ever
called his lands his earth. I will venture to propose a bold
change:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>She is the hope <i>and stay</i> of my <i>full years</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I.ii.25 (18,3) Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light]
[W: dark even] But why nonsense [Warburton's comment]? Is any thing
mere commonly said, than that beauties eclipse the sun? Has not
Pope the thought and the word?</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Sol through white curtains shot a tim'rous ray,</p>
<p>"And spe'd those eyes that must <i>eclipse the day</i>."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Both the old and the new reading are philosophical nonsense, but
they are both, and both equally poetical sense.</p>
<p>I.ii.26 (18,4) Such comfort as do lusty young men feel] To say,
and to say in pompous words, that a <i>young man shall feel</i> as
much in an assembly of beauties, <i>as young men feel in the month
of April</i>, is surely to waste sound upon a very poor sentiment.
I read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Such comfort as do lusty <i>yeomen</i> feel.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>You shall feel from the sight and conversation of these ladies,

</div>
</div>
<p>The first of these lines I do not understand. The old folio
gives no help; the passage is there, <i>Which</i> one <i>more

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Within your view</i> of many, mine being one,</p>
<p>May stand in number, &amp;c.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I.iii.13 (22,1) to my teen] To my sorrow.</p>
<p>I.iii.66 (24,4) It is an honour] The modern editors all read,
<i>it is an honour</i>. I have restored the genuine word ["hour"],
which is more seemly from a girl to her mother. <i>Your, fire</i>,
and such words as are vulgarly uttered in two syllables, are used
as dissyllables by Shakespeare. [The first quarto reads
<i>honour</i>; the folio <i>hour</i>. I have chosen the reading of
the quarto. STEEVENS.] (rev. 1778, X, 28, 2)</p>
<p>I.iii.92 (25,9) That in gold clasps locks in the golden story]
The <i>golden story</i> is perhaps the <i>golden legend</i>, a book
in the darker ages of popery much read, and doubtless often
exquisitely embellished, but of which Canus, one of the popish
doctors, proclaims the author to have been <i>homo ferrei oris,
plumbei cordis</i>.</p>
<p>I.iv.6 (27,2) like a crow-keeper] The word <i>crow-keeper</i> is
explained in Lear.</p>
<p>I.iv.37 (28,8) for I am proverb'd with a grand-sire phrase] The
grandsire phrase is&mdash;<i>The black ox has trod upon my
foot</i>.</p>
<p>I.iv.42 (30,1) Or (save your reverence) love] The word <i>or</i>
obscures the sentence; we ahould read <i>O</i>! for <i>or love</i>.
Mercutio having called the affection vith which Romeo was entangled
by so disrespectful a word as <i>mire</i>, cries out,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>O! save your reverence, love.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I.iv.84 (34,7) Spanish blades] A sword is called a toledo, from
the excellence of the Toletan steel. So Gratius,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"&mdash;Ensis Toletanus</p>
<p>"Unda Tagi non est alie celebranda metallo,</p>

</div>
<p>I.iv.113 (35,9) Direct my sail:] [I have restored this reading
from the elder quarto, as being more congruous to the metaphor in
the preceding line. <i>Suit</i> is the reading of the folio.
STEEVENS.]</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Direct my suit</i>! Guide the <i>sequel</i> of the

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>You are welcome, gentlemen. Come musicians, play.</p>
<p>A ball! a ball! Give room. And foot it, girls]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>These two lines, omitted by the modern editors, I have replaced
from the folio.</p>
<p>I.v.32 (37, 6) good cousin Capulet] This <i>cousin</i> Capulet
is <i>unkle</i> in the paper of invitation; but as Capulet is
described as old, <i>cousin</i> is probably the right word in both
places. I know not how Capulet and his lady might agree, their ages
were very disproportionate; he has been past masking for thirty
years, and her age, as she tells Juliet, is but
eight-and-twenty.</p>
<p>II.Prologue (42,3) <i>Enter CHORUS</i>] The use of this chorus
is not easily discovered; it conduces nothing to the progress of
the play, but relates what is already known, or what the next
scenes will shew; and relates it without adding the improvement of
any moral sentiment.</p>
<p>II.ii.1 (45,1) He jests at scars] That is, Mercutio jests, whom
he overheard.</p>
<p>II.ii.7 (45,2) Be not her maid] Be not a votary to the moon, to
Diana.</p>
<p>II.ii.10 (45,3)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>It is my lady; O! it is my love;</p>
<p>O, that she knew we were!]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This line and half I have replaced.</p>
<p>II.ii.39 (47,7) Thou art thyself, though not a Montague] I think
the true reading is,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Thou art thyself, <i>then</i> not a Montague.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Thou art a being of peculiar excellence, and hast none of the
malignity of the family, from which thou hast thy
name.&mdash;Hanmer reads,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Thour't not <i>thyself</i> so, <i>though</i> a Montague.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>II.iii.15 (53,6) the powerful grace, that lies/In plants]
Efficacious virtue.</p>
<p>II.iii.27 (53,7) Two such opposed foes encamp them still] [W:
opposed kin] <i>Foes</i> may be the right reading, or <i>kings</i>,
but I think <i>kin</i> can hardly be admitted. Two <i>kings</i> are
two opposite <i>powers</i>, two contending <i>potentates</i>, in
both the natural and moral world. The word <i>encamp</i> is proper
to <i>commanders</i>. (see 1765, VIII, 46, 2)</p>
<p>II.iv.20 (57,3) courageous captain of compliments] A complete
master of all the laws of ceremony, the principal man in the
doctrine of punctilio.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"A man of compliments, whom right and wrong</p>
<p>"Have chose as umpire;"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>says our author of Don <i>Armado</i>, the Spaniard, in <i>Love's
Labour Lost</i>.</p>
<p>II.iv.27 (57,6) the hay!] All the terms of the modern
fencing-school were originally Italian; the rapier, or small
thrusting sword, being first used in Italy. The <i>hay</i> is the
word <i>hai</i>, you <i>have</i> it, used when a thrust reaches the
antagonist, from which our fencers, on the same occasion, without
knowing, I suppose, any reason for it, cry out, <i>ha</i>!</p>
<p>II.iv.35 (58,9) these pardonnez-moy's] <i>Pardonnez-moi</i>
became the language of doubt or hesitation among men of the sword,
when the point of honour was grown so delicate, that no other mode
of contradiction would be endured.</p>
<p>II.iv.64 (59,3) then is my pump wall flower'd] Here is a vein of
wit too thin to be easily found. The fundamental idea is, that
Romeo wore <i>pinked</i> pumps, that is, pumps punched with holes
in figures.</p>
<p>II.iv.87 (60,7) a wit of cheverel] <i>Cheverel</i> is
soft-leather for gloves.</p>
<p>II.iv.138 (62,8) No hare, Sir] Mercutio having roared out, <i>So
ho</i>! the cry of the sportsmen when they start a hare; Romeo asks
<i>what he has found</i>. And Mercutio answers, <i>No hare</i>,
&amp;c. The rest is a series of quibbles unworthy of explanation,
which he who does not understand, needs not lament his
ignorance.</p>
<p>II.iv.162 (63,1) none of his skains-mates] The word
<i>skains-mate</i>, I do not understand, but suppose that
<i>skains</i> was some low play, and <i>skains-mate</i>, a
companion at such play.</p>
<p>II.iv.200 (64,2) like a tackled stair] Like stairs of rope in
the tackle of a ship.</p>
<p>II.iv.222 (65,4) Ah, mocker! that's the dog's name. R is for the
nonce; I know it begins with another letter] This passage is thus
in the old folio. <i>A mocker, that's the dog's name. R is for
the</i> no, <i>I know it begins with some other letter.</i> In this
copy the error is but small. I read, <i>Ah, mocker. that's the
dog's name. R is for the</i> nonce, <i>I know it begins with
another letter.</i> For the <i>nonce</i>, is for some <i>design,
for a sly trick</i>.</p>
<p>II.vi.15 (70,2) Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow] He that
travels too fast is as long before he comes to the end of his
journey, as he that travels slow. Precipitation produces
mishap.</p>
<p>III.i.2 (71,1) The day is hot] It is observed, that in Italy
almost all assassinations are committed during the heat of
summer.</p>
<p>III.i.124 (75,6) This day's black fate on more days does depend]
This day's unhappy destiny <i>hangs over</i> the days yet to come.
There will yet be more mischief.</p>
<p>III.i.141 (78,7) Oh! I am fortune's fool] I am always running in
the way of evil fortune, <i>like</i> the fool in the play. <i>Thou
art death's fool</i>, in <i>Measure for Measure</i>. See Dr.
Warburton's note.</p>
<p>III.i.153 (77,8) as thou art true] As thou art <i>just</i> and
<i>upright</i>.</p>
<p>III.i.159 (77,9) How nice the quarrel] How <i>slight</i>, how
<i>unimportant</i>, how <i>petty</i>. So in the last act,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>The letter was not <i>nice</i>, but full of charge</p>
<p>Of dear import.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>III.i.182 (78,2) Affection makes him false] The charge of
falshood on Bonvolio, though produced at hazard, is very just. The
author, who seems to intend the character of Bonvolio as good,
meant perhaps to shew, how the best minds, in a state of faction
and discord, are detorted to criminal partiality.</p>
<p>III.i.193 (78,3) I have an interest in your hate's proceeding:
Sir Thomas Hanmer saw that this line gave no sense, and therefore
put, by a very easy change,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>I have an interest in your <i>heat's</i> proceeding!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>which is undoubtedly better than the old reading which Dr.
Warburton has followed; but the sense yet seems to be weak, and
perhaps a more licentious correction is necessary. I read
therefore,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>I <i>had no</i> interest in your <i>heat's preceding</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This, says the prince, is no quarrel of mine, <i>I had no
interest in your former discord</i>; I suffer merely by your
private animosity.</p>
<p>III.ii.5 (79,3) Spread thy close curtain, love-performing
night,/That run-away's eyes may wink] [Warburton explained the
"run-away" as the "sun"] I am not satisfied with this explanation,
yet have nothing better to propose.</p>
<p>III.ii.10 (80,4) Come, civil night] <i>Civil</i> is <i>grave,
decently solemn</i>.</p>
<p>III.ii.14 (80,5) unmann'd blood] Blood yet unacquainted with
man.</p>
<p>III.ii.25 (81,6) the garish sun] Milton had this speech in his
thoughts when he wrote <i>Il Penseroso</i>.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"&mdash;Civil night,</p>
<p>"Thou sober-suited matron."&mdash;<i>Shakespeare</i>.</p>
<p>"Till civil-suited morn appear."&mdash;<i>Milton</i>.</p>
<p>"Pay no worship to the gairish
sun."&mdash;<i>Shakespeare</i>.</p>
<p>"Hide me from day's gairish eye."&mdash;<i>Milton</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>III.ii.46 (82,7) the death-darting eye of cockatrice] [The
strange lines that follow here in the common books are not in the
old edition. POPE.] The strange lines are these:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>I am not I, if there be such an I,</p>
<p>Or these eyes shot, that makes thee answer I;</p>
<p>If he be slain, say I; or if not, no;</p>
<p>Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>These lines hardly deserve emendatien; yet it may be proper to
observe, that their meanness has not placed them below the malice
of fortune, the two first of them being evidently transposed; we
should read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;That one vowel <i>I</i> shall poison more,</p>
<p>Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice,</p>
<p>Or these eyes shot, that make thee answer, I.</p>
<p>I am not I, &amp;c.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>III.ii.114 (85,9) Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts] Hath put
Tybalt out of my mind, as if out of being.</p>
<p>III.ii.120 (85,1) Which modern lamentation might have mov'd]
This line is left out of the later editions, I suppose because the
editors did not remember that Shakespeare uses <i>modern</i> for
<i>common</i>, or <i>slight</i>: I believe it was in his time
confounded in colloquial language with <i>moderate</i>.</p>
<p>III.iii.112 (89,4)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Unseemly woman in a seeming man!</p>
<p>And ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!]</p>

And thou torn to pieces with thy own weapons.</p>
<p>III.iii.166-168 (91,6) Go hence. Good night] These three lines
are omitted in all the modern editions.</p>
<p>III.iii.166 (91,7) here stands all your state] The whole of your
fortune depends on this.</p>
<p>III.iv.12 (92,9) Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender/Of my
child's love] <i>Desperate</i> means only <i>bold, advent'rous</i>,
as if he had said in the vulgar phrase, <i>I will speak a</i> bold

<p>III.v.20 (94,1) 'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow] The

it be better thus, <i>I have more will to stay, than care to

<p>III.v.31 (94,3) Some say, the lark and loathed toad chang'd

a rustick rhyme,</p>

</div>
<p>These two lines are omitted in the modern editions, and do not
deserve to be replaced, but as they may shew the danger of critical
temerity. Dr. Warburton's change of <i>I would</i> to <i>I wot</i>
was specious enough, yet it it is evidently erroneous. The sense is
this, <i>The lark, they say, has lost her eyes to the toad, and
now</i> I would <i>the toad had her voice too, since she uses it to
the disturbance of lovers</i>.</p>

I mistake not, observed, that in old books <i>unaccustomed</i>
signifies <i>wonderful, powerful, efficacious</i>.</p>
<p>III.v.112 (98,6) in happy time] <i>A la bonne heure</i>. This
phrase was interjected, when the hearer was not quite so well
pleased as the speaker.</p>
<p>III.v.227 (103,3) As living here] Sir T. HANMER reads, <i>as

<p>IV.ii.38 (110,2) We shall be short] That is, we shall be
<i>defective</i>.</p>
<p>IV.iii.3 (110,3) For I have need of many orisons] Juliet plays
most of her pranks under the appearance of religion: perhaps
Shakespeare meant to punish her hypocrisy.</p>
<p>IV.iii.46 (112,6) Alas, alas! it is not like that I] This speech
is confused, and inconsequential, according to the disorder of
Juliet's mind.</p>
<p>IV.iv.4 (113,1) The curfeu bell] I knew not that the
morning-bell is called the <i>curfeu</i> in any other place.</p>
<p>IV.iv.107 (119,9) O, play me some merry dump] This is not in the
folio, but the answer plainly requires it.</p>
<p>V.i (121,1) ACT V. SCENE I. MANTUA] The acts are here properly
enough divided, nor did any better distribution than the editors
have already made, occur to me in the perusal of this play; yet it
may not be improper to remark, that in the first folio, and I
suppose the foregoing editions are in the same state, there is no
division of the acts, and therefore some future editor may try,
whether any improvement can be made, by reducing them to a length
more equal, or interrupting the action at more proper
intervals.</p>
<p>V.i.1 (121,2) If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep] The
sense is, <i>If I may only trust the</i> honesty <i>of sleep</i>,

</div>
</div>
<p>These three lines are very gay and pleasing. But why does
Shakespeare give Romeo this involuntary cheerfulness just before
the extremity of unhappiness? Perhaps to shew the vanity of
trusting to these uncertain and casual exaltations or depressions,
which many consider as certain foretokens of good and evil.</p>
<p>V.i.45 (123,6) A beggarly account of empty boxes] Dr. Warburton
would read, a <i>braggartly</i> account; but <i>beggarly</i> is
probably right: if the <i>boxes</i> were <i>empty</i>, the
<i>account</i> was more <i>beggarly</i>, as it was more
pompous.</p>
<p>V.iii.31 (127,1) a ring that I must use/In dear employment] That
is, <i>action of importance</i>. Gems were supposed to have great
powers and virtues.</p>
<p>V.iii.86 (129,4) her beauty makes/This vault a feasting presence
full of light] A <i>presence</i> is a <i>public room</i>.</p>

<p>V.iii.229 (138,6) <i>Fri.</i> I will be brief] It is much to be
lamented, that the poet did not conclude the dialogue with the
action, and avoid a narrative of events which the audience already
knew.</p>
<p>(141) General Observation. This play is one of the most pleasing
of our author's performances. The scenes are busy and various, the
incidents numerous and important, the catastrophe irresistibly
affecting, and the process of the action carried on with such
probability, at least with such congruity to popular opinions, as
tragedy requires.</p>
<p>Here is one of the few attempts of Shakespeare to exhibit the
conversation of gentlemen, to represent the airy sprightliness of
juvenile elegance. Mr. Dryden mentions a tradition, which might
easily reach his time, of a declaration made by Shakespeare, that
<i>he was obliged to kill Mercutio in the third act, lest he should
have been killed by him</i>. Yet he thinks him <i>no such
formidable person, but that he might have lived through the play,
and died in his bed</i>, without danger to a poet. Dryden well
knew, had he been in quest of truth, that, in a pointed sentence,
more regard is commonly had to the words than the thought, and that
it is very seldom to be rigorously understood. Mercutio's wit,
gaiety, and courage, will always procure him friends that wish him
a longer life; but his death is not precipitated, he has lived out
the time allotted him in the construction of the play; nor do I
doubt the ability of Shakespeare to have continued his existence,
though some of his sallies are perhaps out of the reach of Dryden;
whose genius was not very fertile of merriment, nor ductile to
humour, but acute, argumentative, comprehensive, and sublime.</p>
<p>The Nurse is one of the characters in which the author
delighted: he has, with great subtilty of distinction, drawn her at
once loquacious and secret, obsequious and insolent, trusty and
dishonest.</p>
<p>His comic scenes are happily wrought, but his pathetic strains
are always polluted with some unexpected depravations. His persons,
however distressed, <i>have a conceit left them in their misery, a
miserable conceit</i>.</p>
<h2>HAMLET</h2>
<p>(145,2) This play is printed both in the folio of 1623, and in
the quarto of 1637, more correctly, than almost any other of the
works of Shakespeare.</p>
<p>I.i.29 (147,7) approve our eyes] Add a new testimony to that of
our eyes.</p>
<p>I.i.33 (147,8) What we two nights have seen] This line is by
Hanmer given to Marcellus, but without necessity.</p>
<p>I.i.63 (149,9) He smote the sledded Polack on the ice] Polack
was, in that age, the term for an inhabitant of Poland: Polaque,
French. As in a translation of Passeratius's epitaph on Henry III.
of France, published by Camden:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Whether thy chance or choice thee hither brings,</p>
<p>"Stay, passenger, and wail the best of kings.</p>
<p>"this little stone a great king's heart doth hold,</p>
<p>"Who rul'd the fickle French and Polacks bold:</p>
<p>"So frail are even the highest earthly things,</p>
<p>"Go, passenger, and wail the hap of kings." (rev. 1776, I,
174,3)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I.i.65 (149,2) and just at this dead hour] The old reading is,
<i>jump at this same hour; same</i> is a kind of correlative to
<i>jump; just</i> is in the oldest folio. The correction was
probably made by the author.</p>
<p>I.i.68 (149,4) gross and scope] General thoughts, and tendency
at large. (1773)</p>
<p>I.i.93 (151,7) And carriage of the articles design'd]
<i>Carriage</i>, is <i>import; design'd</i>, is <i>formed, drawn up
between them</i>.</p>
<p>I.i.96 (151,8) Of unimproved mettle hot and full] <i>Full of
unimproved mettle</i>, is full of spirit not regulated or guided by
knowledge or experience.</p>
<p>I.i.100 (151,1) That hath a stomach in't] <i>Stomach</i>, in the
time of our author, was used for <i>constancy, resolution</i>.</p>
<p>I.i.107 (152,3) romage] Tumultous hurry. (1773)</p>
<p>I.i.108-125 (152,3) These, and all other lines confin'd within
crotchets throughout this play, are omitted in the folio edition of
1623. The omissions leave the play sometimes better and sometimes
worse, and seen made only for the sake of abbreviation.</p>
<p>I.i.109 (152,4) Well may it sort] The cause and the effect are
proportionate and suitable. (1773)</p>
<p>I.i.121 (152,7) Was even the like precurse of fierce events] Not
only such prodigies have been seen in Rome, but the elements have
shewn our countrymen like forerunners and foretokens of violent
events. (1773)</p>
<p>I.i.128 (153,1) If thou hast any sound] The speech of Horatio to
the spectre is very elegant and noble, and congruous to the common
traditions of the causes of apparitions.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,</p>
<p>The extravagant and erring spirit hies</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>According to the pneumatology of that tine, every element was
inhabited by its peculiar order of spirits, who had dispositions
different, according to their various places of abode. The meaning
therefore is, that all <i>spirits extravagant</i>, wandering out of
their element, whether aerial spirits visiting earth, or earthly
spirits ranging the air, return to their station, to their proper
limits in which they are <i>confined</i>. We might read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"&mdash;And at his warning</p>
<p>"Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies</p>
<p>"To his confine, whether in sea or air,</p>
<p>"Or earth, or fire. And of, &amp;c.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>But this change, tho' it would smooth the construction, is not
necessary, and being unnecessary, should not be made against
authority.</p>
<p>I.i.163 (154,5) No fairy takes] No fairy <i>strikes</i>, with
lameness or diseases. This sense of <i>take</i> is frequent in this
author.</p>
<p>I.ii.37 (156,8) more than the scope/Of these dilated articles
allows] More than is comprised in the general design of these
articles, which you may explain in a more diffuse and dilated
stile. (1773)</p>

<p>[W: The blood ... Than to the throne] Part of this emendation I
have received, but cannot discern why the <i>head</i> is not as
much <i>native to the heart</i>, as the <i>blood</i>, that is,
<i>natural</i> and <i>congenial</i> to it, <i>born with it</i>, and

</div>
<p>I.ii.65 (158,2) A little more than kin, and less than kind]
<i>Kind</i> is the Teutonick word for <i>child</i>. Hamlet
therefore answers with propriety, to the titles of <i>cousin</i>
and <i>son</i>, which the king had given him, that he was somewhat
more than <i>cousin</i>, and less than <i>son</i>.</p>
<p>I.ii.67 (159,3) too much i' the sun] He perhaps alludes to the
proverb, <i>Out of heaven's blessing into the warm sun</i>.</p>
<p>I.ii.70 (159,4) veiled lids] With lowering eyes, cast down eyes.
(1773)</p>
<p>I.ii.89 (160,5) your father lost a father;/That father lost,
lost his] I do not admire the repetition of the word, but it has so
much of our author's manner, that I find no temptation to recede
from the old copies.</p>
<p>I.ii.92 (160,6) obsequious sorrow] <i>Obsequious</i> is here
from <i>obsequies</i>, or <i>funeral ceremonies</i>.</p>
<p>I.ii.103 (161,9) To reason most absurd] Reason is here used in
its common sense, for the <i>faculty</i> by which we form
conclusions from arguments.</p>
<p>I.ii.110 (161,1) And with no less nobility of love]
[<i>Nobility</i>, for <i>magnitude</i>. WARBURTON.] <i>Nobility</i>
is rather <i>generosity</i>.</p>
<p>I.ii.112 (161,2) Do I impart toward you] I believe <i>impart</i>
is, <i>impart myself</i>, <i>communicate</i> whatever I can
bestow.</p>
<p>I.ii.125 (162,4) No jocund health] The king's intemperance is
very strongly impressed; every thing that happens to him gives him
occasion to drink.</p>
<p>I.ii.163 (164,9) I'll change that name] I'll be your servant,
you shall be my friend. (1773)</p>
<p>I.ii.164 (164,1) what make you] A familiar phrase for <i>what
are you doing</i>.</p>
<p>I.ii.167 (164,2) good Even, Sir] So the copies. Sir Th. Hanmer
and Dr. Warburton put it, <i>good morning</i>. The alteration is of
no importance, but all licence is dangerous. There is no need of
any change. Between the first and eighth scene of this act it is
apparent, that a natural day must pass, and how much of it is
already over, there is nothing that can determine. The king has
held a council. It may now as well be <i>evening</i> as
<i>morning</i>.</p>
<p>I.ii.182 (165,3) 'Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven]
<i>Dearest</i>, for <i>direst</i>, most dreadful, most
dangerous.</p>
<p>I.ii.192 (165,5) Season your admiration] That is, <i>temper</i>
it.</p>
<p>I.ii.204 (166,6) they, distill'd/Almost to jelly with the act of
fear,/Stand dumb] [W: th' effect of] Here is an affectation of
subtilty without accuracy. <i>Fear</i> is every day considered as
an <i>agent</i>. <i>Fear laid hold on him; fear drove him away</i>.
If it were proper to be rigorous in examining trifles, it might be
replied, that Shakespeare would write more erroneously, if he wrote
by the direction of this critick; they were not <i>distilled</i>,
whatever the word may mean, <i>by the effect of fear</i>; for that
<i>distillation</i> was itself the <i>effect</i>; <i>fear</i> was
the cause, the active cause, that <i>distilled</i> them by that
force of operation which we strictly call <i>act</i> involuntary,
and <i>power</i> in involuntary agents, but popularly call
<i>act</i> in both. But of this too much.</p>
<p>I.iii.15 (169,9) The virtue of his will] <i>Virtue</i> seems
here to comprise both <i>excellence</i> and <i>power</i>, and may
be explained the <i>pure effect</i>.</p>
<p>I.iii.21 (169,1) The sanity and health of the whole state] [W:
safety] HANMER reads very rightly, <i>sanity</i>. <i>Sanctity</i>
is elsewhere printed for <i>sanity</i>, in the old edition of this
play.</p>
<p>I.iii.32 (170,2) unmaster'd] i.e. <i>licentious</i>. (1773)</p>
<p>I.iii.34 (170,3) keep you in the rear of your affection] That
is, do not advance so far as your affection would lead you.</p>
<p>I.iii.49 (170,4) Whilst, like a puft and reckless libertine] [W:
Whilest he] The emendation is not amiss, but the reason for it is
very inconclusive; we use the same mode of speaking on many
occasions. When I say of one, <i>he squanders like a
spendthrift</i>, of another, <i>he robbed me like a thief</i>, the
phrase produces no ambiguity; it is understood that the one is a
<i>spendthrift</i>, and the other a <i>thief</i>.</p>
<p>I.iii.64 (172,7) But do not dull thy palm with entertainment/Of
each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade] The literal sense is, <i>Do
not make thy palm callous by shaking every man by the hand</i>. The
figurative meaning may be, <i>Do not by promiscuous conversation
make thy mind insensible to the difference of characters</i>.</p>
<p>I.iii.81 (173,1) my blessing season this in thee!]
[<i>Season</i>, for <i>infuse</i>. WARBURTON.] It is more than to
<i>infuse</i>, it is to infix it in such a manner as that it never
may wear out.</p>
<p>I.iii.83 (173,3) your servants tend] i.e. your servants are
waiting for you. (1773)</p>
<p>I.iii.86 (173,4) 'Tis in my memory lock'd,/And you yourself
shall keep the key of it] That is, By thinking on you, I shall

</div>
</div>
<p>I believe the word <i>wronging</i> has reference, not to the
phrase, but to Ophelia; if you go on <i>wronging it thus</i>, that
is, <i>if you continue to go on thus wrong</i>. This is a mode of
speaking perhaps not very grammatical, but very common, nor have
the best writers refused it.</p>

<p>I.iii.132 (176,2) I would not, in plain terms, from this time
forth,/ Have you so slander any moment's leisure] [The humour of
this is fine. WARBURTON.] Here is another <i>fine</i> passage, of
which I take the beauty to be only imaginary. Polonius says, <i>in
plain terms</i>, that is, not in language less elevated or
embellished than before, but <i>in terms that cannot be
misunderstood</i>: <i>I would not have you so disgrace your most
idle moments, as not to find better employment for them than lord
Hamlet's conversation</i>.</p>
<p>I.iv.9 (177,3) the swaggering up-spring] The blustering
upstart.</p>
<p>I.iv.17 (177,4) This heavy-headed revel, east and west] I should
not have suspected this passage of ambiguity or obscurity, had I
not found my opinion of it differing from that of the learned
critic [Warburton]. I construe it thus, <i>This heavy-headed revel
makes us traduced east and west, and taxed of other
nations</i>.</p>
<p>I.iv.22 (178,5) The pith and marrow of our attribute] The best
and most valuable part of the praise that would be otherwise
attributed to us.</p>
<p>I.iv.32 (178,7) fortune's scar] In the old quarto of 1637, it
is</p>
<div class="poem">

<p>But I think <i>scar</i> is proper.</p>

be accumulated upon man.</p>
<p>I.iv.39-57 (179,2) Angels and ministers of grace defend us!]
Hamlet's speech to the apparition of his father seems to me to
consist of three parts. When first he sees the spectre, he
fortifies himself with an invocation.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Angel and ministers of grace defend us!</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>As the spectre approaches, he deliberates with himself, and
determines, that whatever it be he will venture to address it.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Be thou a spirit of health, or goblin damn'd,</i></p>
<p><i>Bring with thee airs from heaven, or blasts from
hell,</i></p>
<p><i>Be thy intents wicked or charitable,</i></p>
<p><i>Thou com'st in such a questionable shape,</i></p>
<p><i>That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee</i>, &amp;c.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This he says while his father is advancing; he then, as he had
determined, <i>speaks to him</i>, and <i>calls him&mdash;Hamlet,
King, Father, Royal Dane: oh! answer me</i>. (1773)</p>
<p>I.iv.43 (180,4) questionable shape] [By <i>questionable</i> is
meant provoking question. HANMER.] So in <i>Macbeth</i>,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Live you, or are you aught</i></p>
<p><i>That man may</i> question?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I.iv.46 (180,5) tell,/Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in
death,/ Have burst their cearments?] [W: in earth] It were too long
to examine this note period by period, though almost every period
seems to me to contain something reprehensible. The critic, in his
zeal for change, writes with so little consideration, as to say,
that Hamlet cannot call his father <i>canonized</i>, because <i>we
are told he was murdered with all his sins fresh upon him</i>. He
was not then told it, and had so little the power of knowing it,
that he was to be told it by an apparition. The long succession of
reasons upon reasons prove nothing, but what every reader
discovers, that the king had been buried, which is implied by so
many adjuncts of burial, that the direct mention of <i>earth</i> is
not necessary. Hamlet, amazed at an apparition, which, though in
all ages credited, has in all ages been considered as the most
wonderful and most dreadful operation of supernatural agency,
enquires of the spectre, in the most emphatic terms, why he breaks
the order of nature, by returning from the dead; this he asks in a
very confused circumlocution, confounding in his fright the soul
and body. Why, says he, have <i>thy bones</i>, which with due
ceremonies have been intombed <i>in death</i>, in the common state
of departed mortals, <i>burst</i> the folds in which they were
embalmed? Why has the tomb, in which we saw thee quietly laid,
opened his mouth, that mouth which, by its weight and stability,
seemed closed for ever? The whole sentence is this: <i>Why dost
thou appear, whom we know to be dead?</i></p>
<p>Had the change of the word removed any obscurity, or added any
beauty, it might have been worth a struggle; but either reading
leaves the sense the same.</p>
<p>If there be any asperity in this controversial note, it must be
imputed to the contagion of peevishneas, or some resentment of the
incivility shewn to the Oxford editor, who is represented as
supposing the ground <i>canonized</i> by a funeral, when he only
meant to say, that the <i>body</i> has deposited in <i>holy
ground</i>, in ground consecrated according to the
<i>canon</i>.</p>
<p>I.iv.65 (183,9) I do not set my life at a pin's fee] The value
of a pin. (1773)</p>
<p>I.iv.73 (183,1) deprive your sovereignty] I believe
<i>deprive</i> in this place signifies simply to <i>take
away</i>.</p>
<p>I.iv.77 (184,4) confin'd to fast in fires] I am rather inclined
to read, <i>confin'd to</i> lasting <i>fires</i>, to fires
<i>unremitted</i> and <i>unconsumed</i>. The change is slight.</p>
<p>I.v.30 (186,7) As meditation or the thoughts of love] The
comment [Warburton's] on the word <i>meditation</i> is so
ingenious, that I hope it is just.</p>
<p>I.v.77 (188,6) Unhonsel'd, disappointed, unaneal'd] This is a
very difficult line. I think Theobald's objection to the sense of
<i>unaneal'd</i>, for <i>notified by the bell</i>, must be owned to
be very strong. I have not yet by my enquiry satisfied myself.
Hanmer's explication of <i>unaneal'd</i> by <i>unprepar'd</i>,
because to <i>anneal</i> metals, is to <i>prepare</i> them in
manufacture, is too general and vague; there is no resemblance
between any funeral ceremony and the practice of <i>annealing</i>
metals.</p>
<p><i>Disappointed</i> is the same as <i>unappointed</i>, and may
be properly explained <i>unprepared</i>; a man well furnished with
things necessary for any enterprize, was said to be well
<i>appointed</i>.</p>
<p>I.v.80 (190,7) Oh, horrible! oh, horrible! most horrible!] It
was ingeniously hinted to me by a very learned lady, that this line
seems to belong to Hamlet, in whose mouth it is a proper and
natural exclamation; and who, according to the practice of the
stage, may be supposed to interrupt so long a speech. (1773)</p>
<p>I.v.154 (193,5) Swear by my sword] [Here the poet has preserved
the manners of the ancient Danes, with whom it was <i>religion</i>
to swear upon their swords. WARBURTON.] I was once inclinable to
this opinion, which is likewise well defended by Mr. Upton; but Mr.
Garrick produced me a passage, I think, in <i>Brantoms</i>, from
which it appeared, that it was common to swear upon the sword, that
is, upon the cross which the old swords always had upon the
hilt.</p>
<p>II.i.25 (197,8) drinking, fencing, swearing] I suppose, by
<i>fencing</i> is meant a too diligent frequentation of the
fencing-school, a resort of violent and lawless young men.</p>
<p>II.i.46 (197,4) <i>Good Sir</i>, or so, or <i>friend</i>, or
<i>gentleman</i>] [W: sire] I know not that <i>sire</i> was ever a
general word of compliment, as distinct from <i>sir</i>; nor do I
conceive why any alteration should be made. It is a common mode of
colloquial language to use, <i>or so</i>, as a slight intimation of
more of the same, or a like kind, that might be mentioned. We might
read, but we need not,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Good sir</i>, forsooth, <i>or friend, or gentleman</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>Forsooth</i>, a term of which I do not well know the original
meaning, was used to men as well as to women.</p>
<p>II.i.71 (198,5) Observe his inclination in yourself] HANMER
reads, <i>e'en</i> yourself, and is followed by Dr. Warburton; but
perhaps <i>in</i> yourself means, <i>in your own person</i>, not by
spies.</p>
<p>II.i.112 (200,7) I had not quoted him] To <i>quote</i> is, I
believe, to <i>reckon</i>, to take an account of, to take the
<i>quotient</i> or result of a computation.</p>

</div>
<p>This is not the remark of a weak man. The vice of age is too
much suspicion. Men long accustomed to the wiles of life
<i>cast</i> commonly <i>beyond themselves</i>, let their cunning go
further than reason can attend it. This is always the fault of a

<p>II.ii.47 (203,4) the trail of policy] The <i>trail</i> is the
<i>course of an animal pursued by the scent</i>.</p>
<p>Il.ii.52 (203,5) My news shall be the fruit of that great feast]
The <i>desert</i> after the meat.</p>
<p>II.ii.84 (204,7) at night we'll feast] The king's intemperance
is never suffered to be forgotten.</p>
<p>II.ii.86-167 (205,8) My liege, and Madam, to expostulate] This
account of the character of Polonius, though it sufficiently
reconciles the seeming inconsistency of so much wisdom with so much
folly, does not perhaps correspond exactly to the ideas of our
author. The commentator Warburton makes the character of Polonius,
a character only of manners, discriminated by properties
superficial, accidental, and acquired. The poet intended a nobler
delineation of a mixed character of manners and of nature. Polonius
is a man bred in courts, exercised in business, stored with
observations, confident of his knowledge, proud of his eloquence,
and declining into dotage. His mode of oratory is truly represented
as designed to ridicule the practice of those times, of prefaces
that made no introduction, and of method that embarrassed rather
than explained. This part of his character is accidental, the rest
is natural. Such a man is positive and confident, because he knows
that his mind was once strong, and knows not that it is become
weak. Such a man excels in general principles, but fails in the
particular application. He is knowing in retrospect, and ignorant
in foresight. While he depends upon his memory, and can draw from
his repositories of knowledge, he utters weighty sentences, and
gives useful counsel; but as the mind in its enfeebled state cannot
be kept long busy and intent, the old man is subject to sudden
dereliction of his faculties, he loses the order of his ideas, and
entangles himself in his own thoughts, till he recovers the leading
principle, and falls again into his former train. This idea of
dotage encroaching upon wisdom, will solve all the phaenomena of
the character of Polonius.</p>
<p>II.ii.109 (207,1) <i>To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the
most beautified Ophelia</i>] [T: beatified] Both Sir Thomas Hanmer
and Dr. Warburton have followed Theobald, but I am in doubt whether
<i>beautified</i>, though, as Polonius calls it, a <i>vile
phrase</i>, be not the proper word. <i>Beautified</i> seems to be a
<i>vile phrase</i>, for the ambiguity of its meaning, (rev. 1778,
X, 241, 3)</p>
<p>II.ii.126 (208,2) more above] is, <i>moreover, besides</i>.</p>
<p>II.ii.145 (209,6) she took the fruits of my advice] She took the
<i>fruits</i> of advice when she obeyed advice, the advice was then
made <i>fruitful</i>.</p>
<p>II.ii.181 (211,9) For if the sun breed maggots in a dead
dog,/Being a god, kissing carrion] [This is Warburton's emendation
for "a good kissing"] This is a noble emendation, which almost sets
the critic on a level with the author.</p>
<p>II.ii.265 (214,2) the shadow of a dream] Shakespeare has
accidentally inverted an expression of Pindar, that the state of
humanity is the <i>dream</i> of a <i>shadow</i>.</p>
<p>II.ii.269 (215,3) Then are our beggars, bodies] Shakespeare
seems here to design a ridicule of these declamations against
wealth and greatness, that seem to make happiness consist in
poverty.</p>
<p>II.ii.336 (217,7) shall end his part in peace] [After these
words the folio adds, <i>the clown shall make those laugh whose
lungs are tickled o' th' sere</i>. WARBURTON.] This passage I have
omitted, for the same reason, I suppose, as the other editors: I do
not understand it.</p>
<p>II.ii.338 (217,8) the lady shall say her mind freely, or the
blank verse shall halt for't] <i>The lady shall have no
obstruction, unless from the lameness of the verse.</i></p>
<p>II.ii.346 (217,9) I think, their inhibition comes by the means
of the late innovation] I fancy this is transposed: Hamlet enquires
not about an <i>inhibition</i>, but an <i>innovation</i>; the
answer therefore probably was, <i>I think, their</i> innovation,
<i>that is</i>, their new practice of strolling, <i>comes by the
means of the late</i> inhibition.</p>
<p>II.ii.352-379 (218,1) <i>Ham.</i> How comes it? do they grow
rusty?] The lines marked with commas are in the folio of 1623, but
not in the quarto of 1637, nor, I suppose, in any of the
quartos.</p>
<p>II.ii.355 (218,2) cry out on the top of question] The meaning
seems to be, they ask a common question in the highest notes of the
voice.</p>
<p>II.ii.362 (218,3) escoted] Paid.</p>
<p>II.ii.362 (218,4) Will they pursue quality no longer than they
can <i>sing</i>?] Will they follow the <i>profession</i> of players
no longer than they keep the voices of boys? So afterwards he says
to the player, <i>Come, give us a taste of your</i> quality; come,
<i>a passionate speech</i>.</p>
<p>II.ii.370 (219,6) to tarre them on to controversy] To provoke
any animal to rage, is <i>to tarre him</i>. The word is said to
come from the Greek. (1773)</p>
<p>II.ii.380 (219,8) It is not very strange, for mine uncle is king
of Denmark] I do not wonder that the new players have so suddenly
risen to reputation, my uncle supplies another example of the
facility with which honour is conferred upon new claimants.</p>
<p>II.ii.412 (220,2) Buz, buz!] Mere idle talk, the <i>buz</i> of
the vulgar.</p>
<p>II.ii.414 (220,3) <i>Then came each actor on his ass</i>] This
seems to be a line of a ballad.</p>
<p>II.ii.420 (221,6) For the law of writ, and the liberty, these
are the only men] All the modern editions have, <i>the law of</i>
wit, <i>and the liberty</i>; but both my old copies have, <i>the
law of</i> writ, I believe rightly. <i>Writ</i>, for <i>writing,
composition</i>. <i>Wit</i> was not, in our author's time, taken
either for <i>imagination</i>, or <i>acuteness</i>, or <i>both
together</i>, but for <i>understanding</i>, for the faculty by
which we <i>apprehend</i> and <i>judge</i>. Those who wrote of the
human mind distinguished its primary powers into <i>wit</i> and
<i>will</i>. Ascham distinguishes <i>boys</i> of tardy and of
active faculties into <i>quick wits</i> and <i>slow wits</i>.</p>
<p>II.ii.438 (221,8) the first row of the pious chanson] [It is
<i>pons chansons</i> in the first folio edition. POPE.] It is
<i>pons chansons</i> in the quarto too. I know not whence the
<i>rubric</i> has been brought, yet it has not the appearance of an
arbitrary addition. The titles of old ballads were never printed
red; but perhaps <i>rubric</i> may stand for <i>marginal
explanation</i>.</p>
<p>II.ii.439 (222,9) For, look, where my abridgment comes] He calls
the players afterwards, <i>the brief chronicles of the time</i>;
but I think he now means only <i>those who will shorten my
talk</i>.</p>
<p>II.ii.448 (223,2) be not crack'd within the ring] That is,
<i>crack'd too much for use</i>. This is said to a young player who
acted the parts of women.</p>
<p>II.ii.450 (223,3) like French faulconers] HANMER, who has much
illustrated the allusions to falconry, reads, <i>like</i> French
<i>falconers. [French falconers</i> is not a correction by Hanmer,
but the reading of the first folio. STEEVENS.] (see 1765, VIII,
198, 1)</p>
<p>II.ii.459 (223,5) (as I received it, and others whose judgment
in such matters cried in the top of mine)] [i.e. whose judgment I
had the highest opinion of. WARBURTON.] I think it means only that
<i>were higher than mine</i>.</p>
<p>II.ii.466 (224,8) but called it, an honest method] Hamlet is
telling how much his judgment differed from that of others. <i>One
said, there was no salt in the lines</i>, &amp;c. <i>but call'd it
an honest method</i>. The author probably gave it, <i>But I called
it an honest method</i>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>II.ii.525 (226,9) <i>the mobled queen</i>] Mobled signifies
<i>huddled, grossly covered</i>.</p>
<p>II.ii.587 (228,5) the cue for passion] The <i>hint</i>, the
<i>direction</i>.</p>
<p>II.ii.589 (228,6) the general ear] The ears of all mankind. So
before, <i>Caviare to the</i> general, that is, to the
<i>multitude</i>.</p>
<p>II.ii.595 (229,7) unpregnant of my cause] [<i>Unpregnant</i>,
for <i>having no due sense of</i>. WARBURTON.] Rather, <i>not
quickened with a new desire of vengeance; not teeming with
revenge</i>.</p>
<p>II.ii.598 (229,8) A damn'd defeat was made] [<i>Defeat</i>, for
<i>destruction</i>. WARBURTON.] Rather, <i>dispossession</i>.</p>
<p>II.ii.608 (229,1) kindless] <i>Unnatural</i>.</p>
<p>II.ii.616 (229,3) About, my brain!] <i>Wits, to your work</i>.
<i>Brain</i>, go <i>about</i> the present business.</p>
<p>II.ii.625 (230,5) tent him] Search his wounds.</p>
<p>II.ii.632 (230,7) More relative than this] [<i>Relative</i>, for
<i>convictive</i>. WARB.] <i>Convictive</i> is only the
consequential sense. <i>Relative</i> is, <i>nearly related, closely
connected</i>.</p>
<p>III.i.17 (231,2) o'er-raught on the way] <i>Over-raught</i> is
<i>over-reached</i>, that is, <i>over-took</i>.</p>
<p>III.i.31 (232,4) Affront Ophelia.] To <i>affront</i>, is only
<i>to meet directly</i>.</p>
<p>III.i.47 (233,5) 'Tis too much prov'd] It is found by too
frequent experience.</p>
<p>III.i.52 (233,6) more ugly to the thing that helps it] That is,
<i>compared with</i> the thing that helps it.</p>
<p>III.i.56-88 (233,7) To be, or not to be?] Of this celebrated
soliloquy, which bursting from a man distracted with contrariety of
desires, and overwhelmed with the magnitude of his own purposes, is
connected rather in the speaker's mind, than on his tongue, I shall
endeavour to discover the train, and to shew how one sentiment
produces another. Hamlet, knowing himself injured in the most
enormous and atrocious degree, and seeing no means of redress, but
such as must expose him to the extremity of hazard, meditates on
his situation in this manner: <i>Before I can form any rational
scheme of action under this pressure of distress</i>, it is
necessary to decide, whether, <i>after our present state, we
are</i> to be or not to be. That is the question, which, as it
shall be answered, will determine, <i>whether 'tis nobler</i>, and
more suitable to the dignity of reason, <i>to suffer the outrages
of fortune</i> patiently, or to take arms against <i>them</i>, and
by opposing end them, <i>though perhaps</i> with the loss of life.
If <i>to die</i>, were <i>to sleep</i>, no more, <i>and by a sleep
to end</i> the miseries of our nature, such a sleep were
<i>devoutly to be wished</i>; but if <i>to sleep</i> in death, be
<i>to dream</i>, to retain our powers of sensibility, we must
<i>pause</i> to consider, <i>in that sleep of death what dreams may
come</i>. This consideration <i>makes calamity</i> so long endured;
for <i>who would bear</i> the vexations of life, which might be
ended <i>by a bare bodkin</i>, but that he is afraid of something
in unknown futurity? This fear it is that gives efficacy to
conscience, which, by turning the mind upon <i>this regard</i>,
chills the ardour of <i>resolution</i>, checks the vigour of
<i>enterprize</i>, and makes the <i>current</i> of desire stagnate
in inactivity. We may suppose that he would have applied these
general observations to his own case, but that he discovered
Ophelia.</p>
<p>III.i.59 (234,8) Or to take arms against a sea of troubles] [W:
against assail] Mr. Pope proposed <i>siege</i>. I know not why
there should be so much solicitude about this metaphor. Shakespeare
breaks his metaphors often, and in this desultory speech there was
less need of preserving them.</p>
<p>III.i.70 (235,2) the whips and scorns of time] [W: of th' time]
I doubt whether the corruption of this passage is not more than the
editor has suspected. <i>Whips</i> and <i>scorns</i> have no great
connexion with one another, or with <i>time: whips</i> and
<i>scorns</i> are evils of very different magnitude, and though at
all <i>times scorn</i> may be endured, yet the <i>times</i> that
put men ordinarily in danger of <i>whips</i>, are rery rare.
Falstaff has said, that the <i>courtiers would</i> whip <i>him with
their quick wits</i>; but I know not that <i>whip</i> can be used
for a <i>scoff</i> or <i>insult</i>, unless its meaning be fixed by
the whole expression.</p>
<p>I am afraid lest I should venture too far in correcting this
passage. If <i>whips</i> be retained, we may read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>For who would bear the whips and scorns of</i> tyrant.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>But I think that <i>quip</i>, a <i>sneer</i>, a <i>sarcasm</i>,
a <i>contemptuous</i> jest, is the proper word, as suiting very
exactly with <i>scorn</i>. What then must be done with <i>time</i>?
it suits no better with the new reading than with the old, and
<i>tyrant</i> is an image too bulky and serious. I read, but not
confidently,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>For who would bear the</i> quips <i>and scorns of</i>
title.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It say be remarked, that Hamlet, in his enumeration of miseries,
forgets, whether properly or not, that he is a prince, and mentions
many evils to which inferior stations only are exposed.</p>
<p>III.i.77 (236,4) To groan and sweat] All the old copies have,
<i>to</i> grunt <i>and sweat</i>. It is undoubtedly the true
reading, but can scarcely be borne by modern ears.</p>
<p>III.i.89 (237,5) Nymph, in thy orisons] This is a touch of
nature. Hamlet, at the sight of Ophelia, does not immediately
recollect, that he is to personate madness, but makes her an
address grave and solemn, such as the foregoing meditation excited
in his thoughts.</p>
<p>III.i.107 (237,6) That if you be honest and fair, you should
admit no discourse to your beauty] This is the reading of all the
modern editions, and is copied from the quarto. The folio reads,
your honesty <i>should admit no discourse to your beauty</i>. The
true reading seems to be this, <i>If you be honest and fair, you
should admit</i> your honesty <i>to no discourse with your
beauty</i>. This is the sense evidently required by the process of
the conversation.</p>
<p>III.i.127 (238,7) I have thoughts to put them in] <i>To put a
thing into thought</i>, is <i>to think on it</i>.</p>
<p>III.i.148 (239,8) I have heard of your paintings too, well
enough] This is according to the quarto; the folio, for
<i>painting</i>, has <i>prattlings</i>, and for <i>face</i>, has
<i>pace</i>, which agrees with what follows, <i>you jig, you
amble</i>. Probably the author wrote both. I think the common
reading best.</p>
<p>III.i.152 (239,9) make your wantonness your ignorance] You
mistake by <i>wanton</i> affectation, and pretend to mistake by
<i>ignorance</i>.</p>
<p>III.i.161 (239,2) the mould of form] The model by whom all
endeavoured to form themselves.</p>
<p>III.ii.12 (241,3) the groundlings] The meaner people then seem
to have sat below, as they now sit in the upper gallery, who, not
well understanding poetical language, were sometimes gratified by a
mimical and mute representation of the drama, previous to the
dialogue.</p>
<p>III.ii.14 (242,4) inexplicable dumb shews] I believe the meaning
is, <i>shews, without words to explain them</i>.</p>
<p>III.ii.26 (242,6) the very age and body of the time, his form
and pressure] The <i>age</i> of the <i>time</i> can hardly pass.
May we not read, the <i>face</i> and <i>body</i>, or did the author
write, the <i>page</i>? The <i>page</i> suits well with <i>form</i>
and <i>pressure</i>, but ill with <i>body</i>.</p>
<p>III.ii.28 (242,7) pressure] Resemblance, as in a
<i>print</i>.</p>
<p>III.ii.34 (242,8) (not to speak it profanely)] <i>Profanely</i>
seems to relate, not to the praise which he has mentioned, but to
the censure which he is about to utter. Any gross or indelicate
language was called <i>profane</i>.</p>
<p>III.ii.66 (243,9) the pregnant hinges of the knee] I believe the
sense of <i>pregnant</i> in this place is, <i>quick, ready,
prompt</i>.</p>
<p>III.ii.68 (244,1) my dear soul] Perhaps, my <i>clear</i>
soul.</p>
<p>III.ii.74 (244,2) Whose blood and judgment] According to the
doctrine of the four humours, <i>desire</i> and <i>confidence</i>
were seated in the blood, and <i>judgment</i> in the phlegm, and
the due mixture of the humours made a perfect character.</p>
<p>III.ii.89 (244,3) Vulcan's stithy] <i>Stithy</i> is a smith's
<i>anvil</i>.</p>
<p>III.ii.103 (245,4) nor mine now] A man's words, says the
proverb, are his own no longer than he keep them unspoken.</p>
<p>III.ii.112 (245,5) they stay upon your patience] May it not be
read more intelligibly, <i>They stay upon your</i> pleasure. In
<i>Macbeth</i> it is, "Noble Macbeth, we stay upon your
<i>leisure</i>."</p>
<p>III.ii.123 (245,6) Do you think I meant country matters?] I
think we must read, <i>Do you think I meant country</i> manners? Do
you imagine that I meant to sit in your lap, with such rough
gallantry as clowns use to their lasses?</p>
<p>III.ii.137 (246,7) Nay, then, let the devil wear black, for I'll
have a suit of sables] I know not why our editors should, with such
implacable anger, persecute our predecessors. The dead, it is true,
can make no resistance, they may be attacked with great security;
but since they can neither feel nor mend, the safety of mauling
them seems greater than the pleasure; nor perhaps would it much
misbeseem us to remember, amidst our triumphs over the
<i>nonsensical</i> and the <i>senseless</i>, that we likewise are
men; that <i>debemur morti</i>, and, as Swift observed to Burnet,
shall soon be among the dead ourselves.</p>
<p>I cannot find how the common reading is nonsense, nor why
Hamlet, when he laid aside his dress of mourning, in a country
where it was <i>bitter cold</i>, and the air was <i>nipping and
eager</i>, should not have a <i>suit of sables</i>. I suppose it is
well enough known, that the fur of sables is not black.</p>
<p>III.ii.147 (249,1) Marry, this is miching maliche; it means
mischief] [W: malhechor] I think Hanmer's exposition most likely to
be right. Dr. Warburton, to justify his interpretation, must write,
<i>miching</i> for <i>malechor</i>, and even then it will be
harsh.</p>
<p>III.ii.167 (250,3) sheen] Splendor, lustre.</p>
<p>III.ii.177 (250,4) For women fear too much, even as they love]
Here seems to be a line lost, which should have rhymed to
<i>love</i>.</p>
<p>III.ii.192 (251,6) The instances, that second marriage move] The
<i>motives</i>.</p>
<p>III.ii.202 (252,7)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Most necessary 'tis, that we forget</p>
<p>To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The performance of a resolution, in which only the
<i>resolver</i> is interested, is a debt only to himself, which he
may therefore remit at pleasure.</p>
<p>III.ii.206 (252,8)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>The violence of either grief or joy,</p>
<p>Their own enactures with themselves destroy]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>What grief or joy <i>enact</i> or determine in their violence,
is revealed in their abatement. <i>Enactures</i> is the word in the
quarto; all the modern editions have <i>enactors</i>.</p>
<p>III.ii.229 (252,9) An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope] May
my whole liberty and enjoyment be to live on hermit's fare in a
prison. <i>Anchor</i> is for <i>anchoret</i>.</p>
<p>III.ii.250 (253,1) Baptista] <i>Baptista</i> is, I think, in
Italian, the name always of a man.</p>
<p>III.ii.262 (254,4) So you must take your husbands] Read, <i>So
you</i> must take <i>your husbands</i> [in place of "mistake"];
that is, <i>for better, for worse</i>.</p>
<p>III.ii.288 (255,5) with two provencial roses on my rayed shoes]
When shoe-strings were worn, they were covered, where they met in
the middle, by a ribband, gathered into the form of a rose. So in
an old song,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Gil-de-Roy <i>was a bonny boy</i>,</p>
<p><i>Had</i> roses <i>tull his</i> shoen.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>Rayed</i> shoes, are shoes <i>braided</i> in lines.</p>
<p>III.ii.304 (256,1) For if the king like not the comedy/Why,
then, belike] Hamlet was going on to draw the consequence when the
courtiers entered.</p>
<p>III.ii.314 (256,2) With drink, Sir?] Hamlet takes particular
care that his uncle's love of drink shall not be forgotten.</p>
<p>III.ii.346 (257,3) further trade] Further business; further
dealing.</p>
<p>III.ii.348 (257,4) by these pickers] By these hands.</p>
<p>III.ii.373 (258,6) ventages] The holes of a flute.</p>
<p>III.ii.401 (259,9) they fool me to the top of my bent] They
compel me to play the fool, till I can endure to do it no
longer.</p>
<p>III.iii.7 (261,4) Out of his lunes] [The old quartos read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Out of his</i> brows.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This was from the ignorance of the first editors; as is this
unnecessary Alexandrine, which we owe to the players. The poet, I
am persuaded, wrote,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>us doth hourly grow</i></p>
<p><i>out of his</i> lunes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>i.e. his <i>madness, frenzy</i>. THEOBALD.]</p>
<p><i>Lunacies</i> is the reading of the folio.</p>
<p>I take <i>brows</i> to be, properly read, <i>frows</i>, which, I
think, is a provincial word for <i>perverse humours</i>; which
being, I suppose, not understood, was changed to <i>lunacies</i>.
But of this I an not confident. [Steevens adopted Theobald's
emendation]</p>
<p>III.iii.33 (262,7) of vantage] By some opportunity of secret
observation.</p>
<p>III.iii.56 (263,9) May one be pardon'd, and retain the offence?]
He that does not amend what can be amended, <i>retains</i> his
<i>offence</i>. The king kept the crown from the right heir.</p>
<p>III.iii.66 (263,1) Yet what can it, when one cannot repent?]
What can repentance <i>do for a man that cannot be penitent</i>,
for a man who has only part of penitence, distress of conscience,
without the other part, resolution of amendment.</p>
<p>III.iii.77 (264,1) I, his sole son, do this same villain send]
The folio reads foule son, a reading apparently corrupted from the
quarto. The meaning is plain. <i>I, his</i> only <i>son</i>, who am
bound to punish his murderer.</p>
<p>III.iii.88 (264,2) Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent]
[T: bent] This reading is followed by Sir T. HANMER and Dr.
WARBURTON; but <i>hent</i> is probably the right vord. To
<i>hent</i> is used by Shakespeare for, to <i>seize</i>, to
<i>catch</i>, to <i>lay hold on</i>. <i>Hent</i> is, therefore,
<i>hold</i>, or <i>seizure</i>. <i>Lay hold</i> on him, sword, at a
more horrid time.</p>
<p>III.iii.94 (265,3) his soul may be as damn'd and black/As hell,
whereto it goes] This speech, in which Hamlet, represented as a
virtuous character, is not content vith taking blood for blood, but
contrives damnation for the man that he would punish, is too
horrible to be read or to be uttered.</p>
<p>III.iv.4 (266,4) I'll silence me e'en here:/Pray you, be round
vith him] Sir T. HANMER, who is folloved by Dr. WARBURTON,
reads,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>I'll</i> sconce <i>me here</i>.</p>

<p><i>Retire</i> to a place of <i>security</i>. They forget that
the contrivance of Polonius to overhear the conference, was no more
told to the queen than to Hamlet.&mdash;<i>I'll silence me even

<p>[W: O'er this ... visage, and, as 'gainst] The word
<i>heated</i> [from the "old quarto"], though it agrees well enough
with <i>glow</i>, is, I think, not so striking as <i>tristful</i>,
which was, I suppose, chosen at the revisal. I believe the whole
passage now stands as the author gave it. Dr. WARBURTON's reading
restores two improprieties, which Shakespeare, by his alteration,
had removed. In the first, and in the new reading: <i>Heaven's</i>
face <i>glows with tristful</i> visage; and, <i>Heaven's face
is</i> thought-sick. To the common reading there is no just
objection.</p>
<p>III.iv.52 (268,9) what act,/That roars so loud, and thunders in
the index?] The meaning is, <i>What is</i> this act, of which the
<i>discovery</i>, or <i>mention</i>, cannot be made, but with this
violence of clamour?</p>
<p>III.iv.82 (270,5) Rebellious hell,/If thou canst mutiny in a
matron's bones] I think the present reading right, but cannot admit
that HANMER's emendation ["Rebellious heat"] produces nonsense. May
not what is said of <i>heat</i>, be said of <i>hell</i>, that it
will mutiny wherever it is quartered? Though the emendation be
elegant, it is not necessary. (1773)</p>
<p>III.iv.88 (271,6) reason panders will] So the folio, I think
rightly; but the reading of the quarto is defensible;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>reason</i> pardons <i>will</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>III.iv.90 (271,7) grained] Dyed in grain.</p>
<p>III.iv.92 (271,8) incestuous bed] The folio has <i>enseamed</i>,
that is, <i>greasy</i> bed.</p>
<p>III.iv.98 (271,9) vice of kings!] a low mimick of kings. The
vice is the fool of a farce; from whom the modern <i>punch</i> is
descended.</p>
<p>III.iv.102 (272,2) A king of shreds and patches] This is said,
pursuing the idea of the <i>vice of kings</i>. The <i>vice</i> was
dressed as a fool, in a coat of party-coloured patches.</p>
<p>III.iv.107 (272,3) lap's in time and passion] That, having
suffered <i>time</i> to <i>slip</i>, and <i>passion</i> to <i>cool,
lets go</i>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>III.iv.151 (274,6) And do not spread the compost on the weeds/To
make them ranker] Do not, by any new indulgence, heighten your
former offences.</p>
<p>III.iv.155 (274,7) curb] That is, <i>bend</i> and
<i>truckle</i>. Fr. <i>courber</i>.</p>
<p>III.iv.161 (274,8) That monster custom, who all sense doth eat/
Of habits evil, is angel yet in this] [Thirlby: habits evil] I
think THIRLBY's conjecture wrong, though the succeeding editors
have followed it; <i>angel</i> and <i>devil</i> are evidently
opposed. [Steevens accepted "evil"]</p>
<p>III.iv.203 (277,5) adders fang'd] That is, adders with their
<i>fangs</i>, or <i>poisonous teeth</i>, undrawn. It has been the
practice of mountebanks to boast the efficacy of their antidotes by
playing with vipers, but they first disabled their fangs.</p>
<p>IV.i (278,l) <i>A royal apartment. Enter King, Queen,
Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern</i>] This play is printed in the old
editions without any separation of the acts. The division is modern
and arbitrary; and is here not very happy, for the pause is made at
a time when there is more continuity of action than in almost any
other of the scenes.</p>
<p>IV.i.18 (278,2) out of haunt] I would rather read, <i>out of</i>
harm.</p>
<p>IV.i.25 (279,3)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>his very madness, like some ore</p>
<p>among a mineral of metals base,</p>
<p>Shews itself pure]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Shakespeare seems to think <i>ore</i> to be <i>or</i>, that is,
gold. Base metals have <i>ore</i> no less than precious.</p>
<p>IV.ii.19 (281,5) he keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of
his jaw] The quarto has <i>apple</i>, which is generally followed.
The folio has <i>ape</i>, which HANMER has received, and
illustrated with the following note.</p>
<p>"It is the way of monkeys in eating, to throw that part of their
food, which they take up first, into a pouch they are provided with
on the side of their jaw, and then they keep it, till they have
done with the rest."</p>
<p>IV.ii.28 (281,6) The body is with the king] This answer I do not
comprehend. Perhaps it should be, <i>The body is</i> not <i>with
the king</i>, for <i>the king is not with the body</i>.</p>
<p>IV.ii.32 (282,7) Of nothing] Should it not be read, <i>Or</i>
nothing? When the courtiers remark, that Hamlet has contemptuously
called the <i>king a thing</i>, Hamlet defends himself by
observing, that the king must be a <i>thing</i>, or
<i>nothing</i>.</p>
<p>IV.ii.46 (283,9) the wind at help] I suppose it should be read,
<i>The bark is ready, and the wind at</i> helm.</p>
<p>IV.ii.68 (284,3) And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done,/
Howe'er my haps, my joys will ne'er begin] This being the
termination of a scene, should, according to our author's custom,
be rhymed. Perhaps he wrote,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Howe'er my</i> hopes, <i>my joys</i> are not begun.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>If <i>haps</i> be retained, the meaning will be, <i>'till I know
'tis done, I shall be miserable</i>, whatever befall me (see 1785,
VIII, 257, 3)</p>
<p>IV.iv.33 (286,4)</p>

time</i>, be to sleep and feed.</p>
<p>IV.iv.36 (286,5) large discourse] Such latitude of
comprehension, such power of reviewing the past, and anticipating
the future.</p>
<p>IV.iv.53 (286,6) Rightly to be great,/Is not to stir without
great argument] This passage I have printed according to the copy.
Mr. THEOBALD had regulated it thus:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>'Tis not to be great,</i></p>
<p><i>Never to stir without great argument;</i></p>
<p><i>But greatly</i>, &amp;c.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The sentiment of Shakespeare is partly just, and partly
romantic.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>Rightly to be great,</i></p>
<p><i>Is not to stir without great argument</i>;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>is exactly philosophical.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>But greatly to find quarrel in a straw,</i></p>
<p><i>When honour is at stake</i>,</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>is the idea of a modern hero. <i>But then</i>, says he <i>honour
is an argument, or subject of debate</i>, sufficiently great,
<i>and</i> when honour is at stake, we must <i>find cause of
quarrel in a straw</i>.</p>
<p>IV.iv.56 (287,7) Excitements of my reason and my blood]
Provocations which excite both my reason and my passions to
vengeance.</p>
<p>IV.v.37 (289,4) <i>Larded all with sweet flowers</i>] The
expression is taken from cookery. (1773)</p>
<p>IV.v.53 (290,6) <i>And dupt the chamber-door</i>] To <i>dup</i>,
is to <i>do up</i>; to lift the latch. It were easy to write,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">

<p><i>By</i> Cis,&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>That is, by St. Cecily.</p>
<p>IV.v.83 (291,8) but greenly] But <i>unskilfully</i>; with
<i>greenness</i>; that is, without <i>maturity</i> of judgment.</p>
<p>IV.v.84 (291,9) In hugger-mugger to inter him] All the modern
editions that I have consulted give it,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>In</i> private <i>to inter him</i>;&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>That the words now replaced are better, I do not undertake to
prove; it is sufficient that they are Shakespeare's: if phraseology
is to be changed as words grow uncouth by disuse, or gross by
vulgarity, the history of every language will be lost; we shall no
longer have the words of any author; and, as these alterations will
be often unskilfully made, we shall in time have very little of his
meaning.</p>
<p>IV.v.89 (292,1) Feeds on his wonder] The folio reads,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Keeps <i>on his wonder</i>,&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The quarto,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Feeds <i>on</i> this <i>wonder</i>.&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Thus the true reading is picked out from between them. HANMER
reads unnecessarily,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Feeds <i>on his</i> anger.&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>IV.v.92 (292,2) Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,/ Will
nothing stick our persons to arraign] HANMER reads,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Whence animosity, <i>of matter beggar'd</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>He seems not to have understood the connection. <i>Wherein</i>,
that is, <i>in which pestilent speeches, necessity</i>, or, <i>the
obligation of an accuser to support his charge, will nothing
stick</i>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>IV.v.99 (293,4) The ocean, over-peering of his list] The lists
are the barriers which the spectators of a tournament must not
pass.</p>
<p>IV.v.105 (293,5) The ratifiers and props of every ward] [W:
ward] With this emendation, which was in Theobald's edition, Hanmer
was not satisfied. It is indeed harsh. HANMER transposes the lines,
and reads,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>They cry</i>, "Chuse we Laertes for our king;"</p>
<p>The ratifiers and props of every word,</p>
<p><i>Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I think the fault may be mended at less expence, by reading,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Antiquity forgot, custom not known,</i></p>
<p><i>The ratifiers and props of every</i> weal.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>IV.v.110 (294,6) Oh, this is counter, you false Danish dogs]
Hounds run <i>counter</i> when they trace the trail backwards.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>These lines are not in the quarto, and might hare been omitted
in the folio without great loss, for they are obscure and affected;
but, I think, they require no emendation. <i>Love</i> (says
Laertes) is the passion by which <i>nature is most</i> exalted and
<i>refined</i>; and as substances <i>refined</i> and subtilised,
easily obey any impulse, or follow any attraction, some part of
nature, so purified and <i>refined</i>, flies off after the
attracting object, after the thing it loves.</p>
<div class="poem">

</div>
</div>
<p>IV.v.171 (297,1) O how the wheel becomes it!] [W: weal] I do not
see why <i>weal</i> is better than <i>wheel</i>. The story alluded
to I do not know; but perhaps the lady stolen by the steward was
reduced to <i>spin</i>.</p>
<p>IV.v.175 (297,2) There's rosemary, that'll far rememberance.
Pray you, love, remember. And there's pansies, that's for thoughts]
There is probably some mythology in the choice of these herbs, but
I cannot explain it. <i>Pansies</i> is for <i>thoughts</i>, because
of its name, <i>Pens&eacute;es</i>; but <i>rosemary</i> indicates
<i>remembrance</i>, except that it is an ever-green, and carried at
funerals, I have not discovered.</p>
<p>IV.v.214 (300,7) No trophy, sword, nor batchment] It was the
custom, in the times of our author, to hang a sword over the grave
of a knight.</p>
<p>IV.v.218 (300,8) And where the offence is, let the great axe
fall] [W: tax] <i>Fall</i> corresponds better to <i>axe</i>.</p>
<p>IV.vi.26 (301,9) <i>for the bore of the matter</i>] The
<i>bore</i> is the calibier of a gun, or the capacity of the
barrel. <i>The matter</i> (says Hamlet) <i>would carry the heavier
words</i>.</p>
<p>IV.vii.18 (302,1) the general gender] The <i>common race</i> of
the people.</p>
<p>IV.vii.19 (302,2)</p>
<div class="poem">

<p>dipping all his faults in their affection,</p>

<p>This simile is neither very seasonable in the deep interest of
this conversation, nor very accurately applied. If the
<i>spring</i> had changed base metals to gold, the thought had been
more proper.</p>
<p>IV.vii.27 (302,3) if praises may go back again] If I may praise
what has been, but is now to be found no more.</p>
<p>IV.vii.77 (304,5) Of the unworthiest siege] Of the lowest rank.
<i>Siege</i>, for <i>seat, place</i>.</p>
<p>IV.vii.82 (304,6) Importing health and graveness] [W: wealth]
<i>Importing</i> here may be, not <i>inferring</i> by logical
consequence, but <i>producing</i> by physical effect. A young man
regards show in his dress, an old man, <i>health</i>.</p>
<p>IV.vii.90 (305,7) I, in forgery of shapes and tricks/Come short

he could perform.</p>
<p>IV.vii.98 (305,8) in your defence] That is, <i>in the science
of</i> defence.</p>
<p>IV.vii.101 (305,9) The scrimers] The <i>fencers</i>.</p>
<p>IV.vii.112 (305,1) love is begun by time] This is obscure. The
meaning may be, <i>love</i> is not innate in us, and co-essential
to our nature, but begins at a certain time from some external
cause, and being always subject to the operations of time, suffers
change and diminution. (1773)</p>
<p>IV.vii.113 (300,2) in passages of proof] In transactions of
daily experience.</p>
<p>IV.vii.123 (306,4) And then this <i>should</i> is like a
spendthrift sigh/ That hurts by easing] [W: sign] This conjecture
is so ingenious, that it can hardly be opposed, but with the same
reluctance as the bow is drawn against a hero, whose virtues the
archer holds in veneration. Here may be applied what Voltaire
writes to the empress:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Le genereux Francois&mdash;</i></p>
<p><i>Te combat &amp; t'admire.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Yet this emendation, however specious, is mistaken. The original
reading is, not a <i>spendthrift's</i> sigh, but a
<i>spendthrift</i> sigh; a <i>sigh</i> that makes an unnecessary
waste of the vital flame. It is a notion very prevalent, that
<i>sighs</i> impair the strength, and wear out the animal
powers.</p>
<p>IV.vii.135 (307,5) He being remiss] He being not vigilant or
cautious.</p>
<p>IV.vii.139 (307,7) a pass of practice] Practice is often by
Shakespeare, and other writers, taken for an <i>insidious
stratagem</i>, or <i>privy</i> treason, a sense not incongruous to
this passage, where yet I rather believe, that nothing more is
meant than a <i>thrust for exercise</i>.</p>
<p>IV.vii.151 (308,8) May fit us to our shape] May <i>enable</i> us
to <i>assume proper characters</i>, and to act our part.</p>
<p>IV.vii.155 (308,9) blast in proof] This, I believe, is a
metaphor taken from a mine, which, in the proof or execution,
sometimes breaks out with an ineffectual <i>blast</i>.</p>
<p>V.i.3 (310,1) make her grave straight] Make her grave from east
to west in a direct line parallel to the church; not from north to
south, athwart the regular line. This, I think, is meant.</p>
<p>V.i.87 (313,1) which this ass now o'er-reaches] In the quarto,
for <i>over-offices</i> is, <i>over-reaches</i>, which agrees
better with the sentence: it is a strong exaggeration to remark
that an <i>ass</i> can <i>over-reach</i> him who would once have
tried to <i>circumvent</i>.&mdash;I believe both the words were
Shakespeare's. An author in revising his work, when his original
ideas have faded from his mind, and new observations have produced
new sentiments, easily introduces images which have been more newly
impressed upon him, without observing their want of congruity to
the general texture of his original design.</p>
<p>V.i.96 (314,2) and now my lady Worm's] The scull that was <i>my
lord Such a one's</i>, is now my <i>lady Worm's</i>.</p>
<p>V.i.100 (314,3) to play at loggats with 'em?] A play, in which
pins are set up to be beaten down with a bowl.</p>
<p>V.i.149 (316,5) by the card] The <i>card</i> is the paper on
which the different points of the compass were described. <i>To do
any thing by the card</i>, is, <i>to do it with nice
observation</i>.</p>
<p>V.i.151 (316,6) the age is grown so picked] So <i>smart</i>, so
<i>sharp</i>, says HANMER, very properly; but there was, I think,
about that time, a <i>picked</i> shoe, that is, <i>a shoe with a
long pointed toe</i>, in fashion, to which the allusion seems
likewise to be made. <i>Every man now is smart; and every man now
is a man of fashion</i>.</p>
<p>V.i.239 (319,7) winter's flaw!] Winter's <i>blast</i>.</p>
<p>V.i.242 (319,8) maimed rites!] Imperfect obsequies.</p>
<p>V.i.244 (319,9) some estate] Some person of high rank.</p>
<p>V.i.255 (319,2) Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants] I
have been informed by an anonymous correspondent, that
<i>crants</i> is the German word for <i>garlands</i>, and I suppose
it was retained by us from the Saxons. To carry <i>garlands</i>
before the bier of a maiden, and to hang them over her grave, is
still the practice in rural parishes.</p>
<p><i>Crants</i> therefore was the original word, which the author,
discovering it to be provincial, and perhaps not understood,
changed to a term more intelligible, but less proper. <i>Maiden
rites</i> give no certain or definite image. He might have put
<i>maiden wreaths</i>, or <i>maiden garlands</i>, but he perhaps
bestowed no thought upon it, and neither genius nor practice will
always supply a hasty writer with the most proper diction.</p>
<p>V.i.310 (323,6) When that her golden couplets] [W: E'er that]
Perhaps it should be,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Ere yet</i>&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>Yet</i> and <i>that</i> are easily confounded.</p>
<p>V.ii.6 (324,7) mutinies in the bilboes] <i>Mutinies</i>, the
French word for seditious or disobedient fellows in the army or
fleet. <i>Bilboes</i>, the <i>ship's prison</i>.</p>
<p>V.ii.6 (324,8) Rashly,/And prais'd be rashness for it&mdash;Let
us know] Both my copies read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;Rashly,</p>
<p><i>And prais'd be rashness for it</i>, let <i>us know</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Hamlet, delivering an account of his escape, begins with saying,
that he <i>rashly</i>&mdash;and then is carried into a reflection
upon the weakness of human wisdom. I rashly&mdash;praised be
rashness for it&mdash;<i>Let us</i> not think these events casual,
but <i>let us know</i>, that is, <i>take notice and remember</i>,
that we sometimes succeed by <i>indiscretion</i>, when we
<i>fail</i> by <i>deep plots</i>, and infer the perpetual
superintendance and <i>agency</i> of the <i>Divinity</i>. The
observation is just, and will be allowed by every human being who
shall reflect on the course of his own life.</p>
<p>V.ii.22 (325,9) With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life] With
<i>such causes of terror</i>, arising from my character and
designs.</p>
<p>V.ii.29 (325,2) Being thus benetted round with villainies,/ Ere
I could make a prologue to my brains] [W: mark the prologue ...
bane] In my opinion no alteration is necessary. Hamlet is telling
how luckily every thing fell out; he groped out their commission in
the dark without waking them; he found himself doomed to immediate
destruction. Something was to be done for his preservation. An
expedient occurred, not produced by the comparison of one method
with another, or by a regular deduction of consequences, but before
he <i>could make a prologue to his brains, they had begun the
play</i>. Before he could summon his faculties, and propose to
himself what should be done, a complete scheme of action presented
itself to him. His mind operated before he had excited it. This
appears to me to be the meaning.</p>
<p>V.ii.41 (326,5) As peace should still her wheaten garland wear,/
And stand a comma 'tween their amities] HANMER reads,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>And stand a</i> cement&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I am again inclined to vindicate the old reading.</p>
<p>The expression of our author is, like many of his phrases,
sufficiently constrained and affected, but it is not incapable of
explanation. The <i>comma</i> is the note of <i>connection</i> and
continuity of sentences; the <i>period</i> is the note of
<i>abruption</i> and disjunction. Shakespeare had it perhaps in his
mind to write, That unless England complied with the mandate,
<i>war should put a</i> period <i>to their amity</i>; he altered
his mode of diction, and thought that, in an opposite sense, he
might put, that <i>Peace should stand a</i> comma between their
amities. This is not an easy stile; but is it not the stile of
Shakespeare?</p>
<p>V.ii.43 (327,6) as's of great charge] <i>Asses</i> heavily
<i>loaded</i>. A quibble is intended between <i>as</i> the
conditional particle, and <i>ass</i> the beast of burthen. That
<i>charg'd</i> anciently signified <i>leaded</i>, may be proved
from the following passage in <i>The Widow's Tears</i>, by Chapman,
1612.</p>
<p>"Thou must be the <i>ass charg'd with crowns</i> to make way."
(see 1765, VIII, 294, 2)</p>
<p>V.ii.53 (327,7) The changeling never known] A <i>changeling</i>
is a <i>child</i> which the fairies are supposed to leave in the
room of that which they steal.</p>
<p>V.ii.68 (328,1) To quit him] To requite him; to pay him his
due.</p>
<p>V.ii.84 (329,2) Dost know this water-fly] A <i>water-fly</i>,
skips up and down upon the surface of the water, without any
apparent purpose or reason, and is thence the proper emblem of a
busy trifler.</p>
<p>V.ii.89 (329,3) It is a chough] A kind of jackdaw.</p>
<p>V.ii.112 (330,5) full of most excellent differences] Full of
<i>distinguishing</i> excellencies.</p>
<p>V.ii.114 (330,6) the card or calendar of gentry] The general
preceptor of elegance; the <i>card</i> by which a gentleman is to
direct his course; the <i>calendar</i> by which he is to choose his
time, that what he does may be both excellent and seasonable.</p>
<p>V.ii.115 (330,7) for you shall find in him the continent of what
part a gentleman would see] <i>You shall find him containing</i>
and comprising every <i>quality</i> which a <i>gentleman</i> would
desire to <i>contemplate</i> for imitation. I know not but it
should be read, <i>You shall find him the continent</i></p>
<p>V.ii.119 (330,9) and yet but raw neither in respect of his quick
sail] [W: but slow] I believe <i>raw</i> to be the right word; it
is a word of great latitude; <i>raw</i> signifies <i>unripe,
immature</i>, thence <i>unformed, imperfect, unskilful</i>. The
best account of him would be <i>imperfect</i>, in respect of his
quick sail. The phrase <i>quick sail</i> was, I suppose, a
proverbial term for <i>activity of mind</i>.</p>
<p>V.ii.122 (330,1) a soul of great article] This is obscure. I
once thought it might have been, <i>a soul of great altitude</i>;
but, I suppose, <i>a soul of great article</i>, means <i>a soul
of</i> large comprehension, of many contents; the particulars of an
inventory are called <i>articles</i>.</p>
<p>V.ii.122 (331,2) his infusion of such dearth and rareness]
<i>Dearth</i> is <i>dearness</i>, value, price. And his internal
qualities of such value and rarity.</p>
<p>V.ii.131 (331,3) Is't not possible to understand in another
tongue? you will do't, Sir, really] Of this interrogatory remark
the sense ie very obscure. The question may mean, <i>Might not all
this be understood in plainer language</i>. But then, <i>you will
do it, Sir, really</i>, seems to have no use, for who could doubt
but plain language would be intelligible? I would therefore read,
<i>Is't possible</i> not to be understood in a mother
<i>tongue</i>. You will do it, Sir, really.</p>
<p>V.ii.140 (331,4) if you did, it would not much approve me] If
you knew I was not ignorant, your esteem would not nuch advance my
reputation. To <i>approve</i>, is to <i>recommend to
approbation</i>.</p>
<p>V.ii.145 (331,5) I dare not confess that, lest I should compare
with him in excellence] I dare not pretend to know him, lest I
should pretend to an equality: no man can completely know another,
but by knowing himself, which is the utmost extent of human
wisdom.</p>
<p>V.ii.149 (332,6) in his meed] In his excellence.</p>
<p>V.ii.156 (332,7) impon'd] Perhaps it should be, <i>depon'd</i>.
So Hudibras,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"I would upon this cause <i>depone</i>,</p>
<p>"As much as any I have known."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>But perhaps <i>imponed</i> is pledged, <i>impawned</i>, so spelt
to ridicule the affectation of uttering English words with French
pronunciation.</p>
<p>V.ii.165 (332,9) more germane.] More<i>a-kin</i>.</p>
<p>V.ii.172 (333,1) The king, Sir, hath laid, that in a dozen
passes between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three
hits; he hath laid on twelve for nine] This wager I do not
understand. In a dozen passes one must exceed the other more or
less than three hits. Nor can I comprehend, how, in a dozen, there
can be twelve to nine. The passage is of no importance; it is
sufficient that there was a wager. The quarto has the passage as it
stands. The folio, <i>He hath one twelve for mine</i>.</p>
<p>V.ii.193 (333,2) This lapwing runs away with the shell on his
head] I see no particular propriety in the image of the lapwing.
Osrick did not run till he had done his business. We may read,
<i>This lapwing</i> ran <i>away</i>&mdash;That is, <i>this fellow
was full of unimportant bustle from his birth</i>.</p>
<p>V.ii.199 (334,4) a kind of yesty collection, which carries them
through and through the most fond and winnowed opinions] [W: most
fann'd] This is a very happy emendation; but I know not why the
critic should suppose that <i>fond</i> was printed for
<i>fann'd</i> in consequence of any reason or reflection. Such
errors, to which there is no temptation but idleness, and of which
there was no cause but ignorance, are in every page of the old
editions. This passage in the quarto stands thus: "They have got
out of the habit of encounter, a kind of misty collection, which
carries them through and through the most profane and renowned
opinions." If this printer preserved any traces of the original,
our author wrote, "the most fane and renowned opinions," which is
better than fann'd and winnow'd.</p>
<p>The meaning is, "these men have got the cant of the day, a
superficial readiness of slight and cursory conversation, a kind of
frothy collection of fashionable prattle, which yet carried them
through the most select and approved judgment. This airy facility
of talk sometimes imposes upon wise men."</p>
<p>Who has not seen this observation verified?</p>
<p>V.ii.201 (335,6) and do but blow them to their trials, the
bubbles are out] These men of show, without solidity, are like
bubbles raised from soap and water, which dance, and glitter, and
please the eye, but if you extend them, by blowing hard, separate
into a mist; so if you oblige these specious talkers to extend
their compass of conversation, they at once discover the tenuity of
their intellects.</p>
<p>V.ii.216 (335,7) gentle entertainment] Mild and temperate
conversation.</p>
<p>V.ii.234 (336,1) Since no man knows aught of what he leaves,
what is't to leave betimes?] The reading of the quarto was right,
but in some other copy the harshness of the transposition was
softened, and the passage stood thus: <i>Since no man knows aught
of what he leaves</i>. For <i>knows</i> was printed in the later
copies <i>has</i>, by a slight blunder in such typographers.</p>
<p>I do not think Dr. Warburton's interpretation of the passage the
best that it will admit. The meaning may be this, Since <i>no man
knows aught of</i> the state of life which <i>he leaves</i>, since
he cannot judge what others years may produce, why should he be
afraid of <i>leaving</i> life betimes? Why should he dread an early
death, of which he cannot tell whether it is an exclusion of
happiness, or an interception of calamity. I despise the
superstition of augury and omens, which has no ground in reason or
piety; my comfort is, that I cannot fall but by the direction of
Providence.</p>
<p>Hanmer has, <i>Since no man</i> owes <i>aught</i>, a conjecture
not very reprehensible. Since <i>no man can call any possession
certain</i>, what is it to leave?</p>
<p>V.ii.237 (337,2) Give me your pardon, Sir] I wish Hamlet had
made some other defence; it is unsuitable to the character of a
good or a brave man, to shelter himself in falsehood.</p>
<p>V.ii.272 (338,5) Your grace hath laid upon the weaker side] Thus
Hanmer. All the others read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Your grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>When the odds were on the side of Laertes, who was to hit Hamlet
twelve times to nine, it was perhaps the author's slip.</p>
<p>V.ii.310 (340,7) you make a wanton of me] A <i>wanton</i> was, a
man feeble and effeminate. In <i>Cymbeline</i>, Imogen says,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"I am not so citizen a <i>wanton</i>,</p>
<p>To die, ere I be sick."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>V.ii.346 (342,8) That are but mutes or audience to this act]
That are either mere <i>auditors</i> of this <i>catastrophe</i>, or
at most only <i>mute performers</i>, that fill the stage without
any part in the action.</p>
<p>V.ii.375 (344,2) This quarry cries, on havock!] Hanmer
reads,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>cries</i> out, <i>havock!</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>To <i>cry on</i>, was to <i>exclaim against</i>. I suppose, when
unfair sportsmen destroyed more <i>quarry</i> or <i>game</i> than
was reasonable, the censure was to cry, <i>Havock</i>.</p>
<p>(346) General Observation. If the dramas of Shakespeare were to
be characterised, each by the particular excellence which
distinguishes it from the rest, we must allow to the tragedy of
Hamlet the praise of variety. The incidents are so numerous, that
the argument of the play would make a long tale. The scenes are
interchangeably diversified with merriment and solemnity; with
merriment that includes judicious and instructive observations, and
solemnity, not strained by poetical violence above the natural
sentiments of man. New characters appear from time to time in
continual succession, exhibiting various forms of life and
particular modes of conversation. The pretended madness of Hamlet
causes much mirth, the mournful distraction of Ophelia fills the
heart with tenderness, and every personage produces the effect
intended, from the apparition that in the first act chills the
blood with horror, to the fop in the last, that exposes affectation
to just contempt. The conduct is perhaps not wholly secure against
objections. The action is indeed for the most part in continual
progression, but there are some scenes which neither forward nor
retard it. Of the feigned madness of Hamlet there appears no
adequate cause, for he does nothing which he might not have done
with the reputation of sanity. He plays the madman most, when he
treats Ophelia with so much rudeness, which seems to be useless and
wanton cruelty.</p>
<p>Hamlet is, through the whole play, rather an instrument than an
agent. After he has, by the stratagem of the play, convicted the
king, he makes no attempt to punish him, and his death is at last
effected by an incident which Hamlet had no part in producing.</p>
<p>The catastrophe is not very happily produced; the exchange of
weapons is rather an expedient of necessity, than a stroke of art.
A scheme might easily have been formed to kill Hamlet with the
dagger, and Laertes with the bowl.</p>
<p>The poet is accused of having shewn little regard to poetical
justice, and may be charged with equal neglect of poetical
probability. The apparition left the regions of the dead to little
purpose; the revenge which he demands is not obtained, but by the
death of him that was required to take it; and the gratification
which would arise from the destruction of an usurper and a
murderer, is abated by the untimely death of Ophelia, the young,
the beautiful, the harmless, and the pious.</p>

<p>This is one of the passages which must for the present be

with any approach to confidence, propose. I cannot think it very
plain from Act 3. Scene 1. that Cassio was or was not a
Florentine.</p>
<p>I.i.30 (361,6) must be belee'd and calm'd] [&mdash;<i>must

<p>I.i.39 (361,9) If I in any just term am affin'd] <i>Affine</i>
is the reading of the third quarto and the first folio. The second
quarto and all the modern editions have <i>assign'd</i>. The
meaning is, <i>Do I stand</i> within <i>any such</i> terms <i>of

<p>I.i.49 (362,1) honest knaves] <i>Knave</i> is here for

<p>I.ii.2 (368,3) stuff o' the conscience] This expression to
common readers appears harsh. <i>Stuff</i> of the <i>conscience</i>
is, <i>substance</i>, or <i>essence</i> of the conscience.
<i>Stuff</i> is a word of great force in the Teutonic languages.
The elements are called in Dutch, <i>Hoefd stoffen</i>, or <i>head
stuffs</i>.</p>
<p>I.ii.13 (368,4) And hath, in his effect, a voice potential/As
double as the duke's] [Warburton had given a source in Dioscorides
and Theocritus for "double"] This note has been much censured by
Mr. Upton, who denies, that the quotation is in Dioscorides, and
disputes, not without reason, the interpretation of Theocritus.</p>
<p>All this learning, if it had even been what it endeavours to be
thought, is, in this place, superfluous. There is no ground of
supposing, that our author copied or knew the Greek phrase; nor
does it follow, that, because a word has two senses in one
language, the word which in another answers to one sense, should
answer to both. <i>Manus</i>, in Latin, signifies both a
<i>hand</i> and <i>troop of soldiers</i>, but we cannot say, that
<i>the captain marched at the</i> head <i>of his</i> hand; or, that
<i>he laid his</i> troop <i>upon his sword</i>. It is not always in
books that the meaning is to be sought of this writer, who was much
more acquainted with naked reason and with living manners.</p>
<p><i>Double</i> has here its natural sense. The president of every
deliberative assembly has a <i>double voice</i>. In our courts, the
chief justice and one of the inferior judges prevail over the other
two, because the chief justice has a <i>double</i> voice.</p>
<p>Brabantio had, <i>in his effect</i>, though not by law, yet by
<i>weight</i> and <i>influence</i>, a voice not <i>actual</i> and
formal, but <i>potential</i> and operative, as <i>double</i>, that
is, a voice that when a question was suspended, would turn the
balance as effectually <i>as the duke's</i>. <i>Potential</i> is
used in the sense of science; a <i>caustic</i> is called
<i>potential</i> fire.</p>
<p>I.ii.23 (370,7) speak, unbonnetted] [Pope: unbonnetting] I do
not see the propriety of Mr. Pope's emendation, though adopted by
Dr. Warburton. <i>Unbonnetting</i> may as well be, <i>not putting
on</i>, as <i>not putting off</i>, the bonnet. Hamner reads
<i>e'en</i> bonnetted.</p>
<p>I.ii.26 (370,8) unhoused] Free from <i>domestic</i> cares. A
thought natural to an adventurer.</p>
<p>I.ii.28 (370,9) For the sea's worth] I would not marry her,
though she were as rich as the Adriatic, which the Doge annually

<p>I.iii.54 (377,6) Hath rais'd me from my bed; nor doth the

<p>Rymer, in his criticism on this play, has changed it to
<i>portents</i>, instead of <i>portance</i>. POPE.] Mr. Pope has
restored a line, to which there is little objection, but which has
no force. I believe <i>portance</i> was the author's word in some
revised copy. I read thus,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Of being&mdash;&mdash;sold</i></p>
<p><i>To slavery, of my redemption, thence,</i></p>
<p><i>And portance in't; my travel's history.</i></p>
<p>My redemption from slavery, and behaviour in it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I.iii.140-170 (381,7) Wherein of antres vast, and desarts idle]
Whoever ridicules this account of the progress of love, shows his
ignorance, not only of history, but of nature and manners. It is no
wonder that, in any age, or in any nation, a lady, recluse,
timorous, and delicate, should desire to hear of events and scenes
which she could never see, and should admire the man who had
endured dangers and performed actions, which, however great, were
yet magnified by her timidity. [Pope: deserts wild] Every mind is
liable to absence and inadvertency, else Pope could never have
rejected a word so poetically beautiful. Idle is an epithet used to
express the infertility of the chaotic state, in the Saxon
translation of the Pentateuch. (1773)</p>
<p>I.iii.140 (382,8) antres] [French grottos. POPE.] Rather
<i>caves</i> and <i>dens</i>.</p>
<p>I.iii.142 (382,9) It was my hint to speak] [W: hent] <i>Hent</i>
is not used in Shakespeare, nor, I believe, in any other author;
<i>hint</i>, or <i>cue</i>, is comnonly used for occasion of
speech, which is explained by, <i>such was the process</i>, that
is, the course of the tale required it. If <i>hent</i> be restored,
it may be explained by <i>handle</i>. I had a <i>handle</i>, or
<i>opportunity</i>, to speak of cannibals.</p>
<p>I.iii.144 (382,1) men whose heads/Do grow beneath their
shoulders] Of these men there is an account in the interpolated
travels of Mondeville, a book of that time.</p>

Hanmer reads,</p>

<p><i>Let me</i> now speak <i>more</i> like your self.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Dr. Warburton's emendation is specious; but I do not see how
Hanmer's makes any alteration. The duke seems to mean, when he says
he will speak like Brabantio, that he will speak sententiously.</p>
<p>I.iii.213 (385,6) But the free comfort which from thence he
hears] But the moral precepts of consolation, which are liberally

<p>I.iii.232 (386,8) thrice-driven bed of down] A <i>driven</i>

heavy.</p>

<p>I desire, that a proper <i>disposition</i> be made for my wife,
that she may have <i>precedency</i>, and <i>revenue</i>,

[W: to forms, my fortunes] There is no need of this emendation.

acted</i>. Breach of common rules and obligations. The old quarto
has, <i>scorn</i> of fortune, which is perhaps the true
reading.</p>
<p>I.iii.253 (388,3) I saw Othello's visage in his mind] It must

<p>Nor to comply with heat (the young affects,</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>[T: me distinct, i.e. with that heat and new affections which
the indulgence of my appetite has raised and created. This is the
meaning of <i>defunct</i>, which has made all the difficulty of the
passage. WARBURTON.] I do not think that Mr. Theobald's emendation
clears the text from embarrassment, though it is with a little
imaginary improvement received by Hanmer, who reads thus:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Nor to comply with heat</i>, affects the young</p>
<p><i>In my</i> distinct <i>and proper satisfaction</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Dr. Warburton's explanation is not more satisfactory: what made
the difficulty, will continue to make it. I read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>I beg it not,</i></p>
<p><i>To please the palate of my appetite,</i></p>
<p><i>Nor to comply with heat (the young affects</i></p>
<p><i>In me defunct) and proper satisfaction;</i></p>
<p><i>But to be free and bounteous to her mind.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>Affects</i> stands here, not for <i>love</i>, but for
<i>passions</i>, for that by which any thing is affected. <i>I ask
it not</i>, says he, <i>to please appetite, or satisfy loose
desires</i>, the passions of youth which I have now outlived, or
<i>for any particular gratification of myself, but merely that I
may indulge the wishes of my wife</i>.</p>
<p>Mr. Upton had, before me, changed <i>my</i> to <i>me</i>; but he
has printed young <i>effects</i>, not seeming to know that
<i>affects</i> could be a noun. (1773)</p>
<p>I.iii.290 (391,6) If virtue no delighted beauty lack] [W:

</div>
<p>Of many different things, all planned with the same art, and
promoted with the same diligence, some must succeed sooner than
others, by the order of nature. Every thing cannot be done at once;
we must proceed by the necessary gradation. We are not to
<i>despair</i> of slow events any <i>more</i> than of tardy fruits,
while the causes are in regular progress, and the fruits <i>grow
fair against the sun</i>. Hanmer has not, I think, rightly
conceived the sentiment; for he reads,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Those fruits which blossom first</i>, are not first
<i>ripe</i>.</p>

<p>III.iii.90 (433,2) Excellent wretch!&mdash;Perdition catch my
soul,/But I do love thee!] The meaning of the word <i>wretch</i>,
is not generally understood. It is now, in some parts of England, a
term of the softest and fondest tenderness. It expresses the utmost
degree of amiableness, joined with an idea, which perhaps all
tenderness includes, of feebleness, softness, and want of
protection. Othello, considering Desdemona as excelling in beauty
and virtue, soft and timorous by her sex, and by her situation
absolutely in his power, calls her <i>Excellent wretch!</i> It may
be expressed,</p>

<p><i>Dear, harmless, helpless Excellence.</i></p>

When my love is for a moment suspended by suspicion, I have nothing

<p>III.iii.123 (435,4) They are close delations working from the
heart,/ That passion cannot rule] <i>They are</i> cold dilations
<i>working from the heart,/That passion cannot rule</i>.] I know
not why the modern editors are satisfied with this reading, which
no explanation can clear. They might easily have found, that it is
introduced without authority. The old copies uniformly give,
<i>close dilations</i>, except that the earlier quarto has <i>close
denotements</i>; which was the author's first expression,
afterwards changed by him, not to <i>cold dilations</i>, for
<i>cold</i> is read in no ancient copy; nor, I believe, to <i>close
dilations</i>, but to <i>close delations</i>; to <i>occult</i> and
<i>secret accusations, working</i> involuntarily <i>from the
heart</i>, which, though resolved to conceal the fault, cannot rule
its <i>passion</i> of resentment.</p>
<p>III.iii.127 (435,5) Or, those that be not, 'would they might
seem none!] [W: seem knaves] I believe the meaning is, <i>would
they might no longer seem</i>, or bear the shape of <i>men</i>.</p>

<p>III.iii.166 (437,9) the green-ey'd monster, which doth make/The
meat it feeds on] <i>which doth</i> mock <i>The meat it feeds
on</i>.] I have received Hanmer's emendation ["make"]; because
<i>to mock</i>, does not signify <i>to loath</i>; and because, when
Iago bids Othello <i>beware of jealousy, the green-eyed
monster</i>, it is natural to tell why he should beware, and for
caution he gives him two reasons, that jealousy <i>often</i>
creates its own cause, and that, when the causes are real, jealousy
is misery.</p>
<p>III.iii.173 (438,1) But riches, fineless] Unbounded, endless,

</div>
</div>
<p>This odd and far-fetched word was made yet more uncouth in all
the editions before Hanmer's, by being printed,
<i>exsufflicate</i>. The allusion is to a bubble. Do not think,
says the Moor, that I shall change the noble designs that now
employ my thoughts, to suspicions which, like bubbles <i>blown</i>
into a wide extent, have only an empty shew without solidity, or
that in consequence of such empty fears, I will close with thy
inference against the virtue of my wife.</p>
<p>III.iii.188 (439,4) Where virtue is, those are most virtuous] An
action in itself indifferent grows virtuous by its end and

<p>Here Iago seems to be a Venetian.</p>
<p>III.iii.207 (440,7) And, when she seem'd to shake, and fear your
looks,/She lov'd them most] This and the following argument of Iago
ought to be deeply impressed on every reader. Deceit and falsehood,
whatever conveniencies they may for a time promise or produce, are,
in the sum of life, obstacles to happiness. Those, who profit by
the cheat, distruat the deceiver, and the act, by which kindness
was sought, puts an end to confidence.</p>
<p>The same objection may be made with a lower degree of strength
against the imprudent generosity of disproportionate marriages.
When the first heat of passion is over, it is easily succeeded by
suspicion, that the same violence of inclination, which caused one
irregularity, may stimulate to another; and those who have shown,
that their passions are too powerful for their prudence, will, with
very alight appearances againat them, be censured, as not very
likely to restrain them by their virtue. (see 1765, VIII, 397,

<p>III.iii.262 (443,8) I'd whistle her off, and let her down the
wind,/ To prey at fortune] The falconers always let fly the hawk
against the wind; if she flies with the wind behind her, she seldom
returns. If therefore a hawk was for any reason to be dismissed,
she was <i>let down the wind</i>, and from that time shifted far
herself, and <i>preyed at fortune</i>. This was told me by the late
Mr. Clark.</p>

<p>The sense is plain, but of the expression I cannot produce any

</div>
</div>
<p>Dr. Warburton has offered <i>fear-spersing</i>, for
<i>fear-dispersing</i>. But <i>ear-piercing</i> is an epithet so
eminently adapted to the <i>fife</i>, and so distinct from the
shrillness of the trumpet, that it certainly ought not to be
changed. Dr. Warburton has been censured for this proposed
emendation with more noise than honesty, for he did not himself put
it in the text.</p>
<p>III.iii.369 (449,8) abandon all remorse] [<i>Remorse</i>, for

<p>III.iii.429 (451,4) <i>Oth.</i> 'tis a shrewd doubt] [The old
quarto gives this line, with the two following, to Iago; and
rightly. WARB.] I think it more naturally spoken by Othello, who,
by dwelling so long upon the proof, encouraged Iago to enforce
it.</p>

<p>[Pope: Not to obey] [T: Nor, to obey.] [W: me. Remord] Of these
two emendations, I believe, Theobald's will have the greater number
of suffrages; it has at least mine. The objection against the
propriety of the declaration in Iago is a cavil; he does not say
that he has no principle of remorse, but that it shall not operate
against Othello's commands. <i>To obey shall be in me</i>, for <i>I
will obey you</i>, is a mode of expression not worth the pains here
taken to introduce it; and the word <i>remords</i> has not in the
quotation the meaning of <i>withhold</i>, or <i>make reluctant</i>,
but of <i>reprove</i>, or <i>censure</i>; nor do I know that it is
used by any of the contemporaries of Shakespeare.</p>
<p>I will offer an interpretation, which, if it be received, will
make alteration unnecessary, but it is very harsh and violent. Iago
devotes himself to wronged Othello, and says, <i>Let him command
whatever bloody business</i>, and in me it shall be an act, not of
cruelty, but <i>of tenderness, to obey him</i>; not of malice to
other, but of <i>tenderness</i> for him. If this sense be thought
too violent, I see nothing better than to follow Pope's reading, as
it is improved by Theobald.</p>

explains this is an allusion to James the First's practice of
creating baronets for money and emends to "The hands of old gave
hearts"] The historical observation is very judicious and acute,
but of the emendation there is no need. She says, that her hand
gave away <i>her heart</i>. He goes on with his suspicion, and the
hand which he had before called <i>frank</i>, he now terms
<i>liberal</i>; then proceeds to remark, that <i>the hand was
formerly given by the heart</i>; but now it neither gives it, nor
is given by it.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>salt and</i> sullen <i>rheum</i>&mdash;-</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>That is, a <i>rheum obstinately troublesome</i>. I think this
better.</p>
<p>III.iv.70 (459,8)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>A Sybil, that had numbred in the world</p>
<p>The sun to course two hundred compasses]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The expression is not very infrequent; we say, <i>I counted the
clock to strike four</i>; so she <i>number'd</i> the sun <i>to
course</i>, to run <i>two hundred compasses</i>, two hundred annual
circuits.</p>
<p>III.iv.79 (460,1) Why do you speak so startingly, and rash?] Is
<i>vehement, violent</i>.</p>
<p>III.iv.103 (461,2) 'Tis not a year, or two, shews us a man] From
this line it may be conjectured, that the author intended the
action of the play to be considered as longer than is marked by any
note of time. Since their arrival at Cyprus, to which they were
hurried on their wedding-night, the fable seems to have been in one
continual progress, nor can I see any vacuity into which a <i>year
or two</i>, or even a month or two, could be put. On the night of
Othello's arrival, a feast was proclaimed; at that feast Cassio was
degraded, and immediately applies to Desdemona to get him restored.
Iago indeed advises Othello to hold him off a while, but there is
no reason to think, that he has been held off long. A little longer
interval would increase the probability of the story, though it
might violate the rules of the drama. See Act. 5. Sc. 2. (see 1765,
VIII, 416, 1)</p>
<p>III.iv.113 (461,3) the duty of my heart] &mdash;the office <i>of
my heart</i>.] The elder quarto reads,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>the</i> duty <i>of my heart</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The author used the more proper word, and then changed it, I
suppose, for fashionable diction; but, as fashion is a very weak
protectress, the old word is now ready to resume its place.</p>
<p>III.iv.119 (462,4)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>But to know so, must be my benefit]</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Si nequeo placidas affari Caesaris aures,</p>
<p>"Saltem aliquis veniat, qui mihi dicat, abi."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>III.iv.125 (462,7) in favour] In <i>look</i>, in
<i>countenance</i>.</p>
<p>III.iv.128 (462,8) within the blank of his displeasure] Within
the <i>shot</i> of his anger.</p>
<p>III.iv.141 (463,9) some unhatch'd practice] Some treason that
has not taken effect.</p>
<p>III.iv.146 (463,1)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>for let our finger ach,</p>
<p>And it endues our other healthful members</p>
<p>Even to that sense of pain]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>Endue with a sense of pain</i>, is an expression, which,
though it might be endured, if it were genuine, cannot deserve to
be introduced by artifice. The copies, both quarto and folio, read,
<i>Endue our other healthful members even to a sense of pain</i>. I
believe it should be rather, SUBDUE <i>our other healthful members
to a sense of pain</i>.</p>
<p>III.iv.151 (463,2) (unhandsome warrior as I am)] [W: wrangler]
<i>Unhandsome warrior</i>, is evidently <i>unfair
assailant</i>.</p>
<p>III.iv.178 (464,3) a more continuate time]&mdash;<i>more</i>
convenient <i>time</i>] The folio has,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>more</i> continuate <i>time</i>;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Time <i>less interrupted</i>, time which I can call more my own.
It gives a more distinct image than <i>convenient</i>.</p>
<p>III.iv.180 (464,4) Take me this work out] The meaning is not,
"Pick out the work, and leave the ground plain;" but, "Copy this
work in another handkerchief."</p>
<p>IV.i.5 (466,6)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm?</p>
<p>It is hypocrisy against the devil]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>Hypocrisy against the devil</i>, means hypocrisy to cheat the
devil. As common hypocrites cheat men, by seeming good, and yet
living wickedly, these men would cheat the devil, by giving him
flattering hopes, and at last avoiding the crime which he thinks
them ready to commit.</p>
<p>IV.i.22 (467,8) Boding to all] Thus all the old copies. The
moderns, less grammatically,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Boding to</i> ill&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>IV.i.42 (468,2) without sone instruction] [W: induction] This is
a noble conjecture, and whether right or wrong does honour to its
author. Yet I am in doubt whether there is any necessity of
emendation. There has always prevailed in the world an opinion,
that when any great calamity happens at a distance, notice is given
of it to the sufferer by some dejection or perturbation of mind, of
which he discovers no external cause. This is ascribed to that
general communication of one part of the universe with another,
which is called sympathy and antipathy; or to the secret monition,
<i>instruction</i>, and influence of a superior Being, which
superintends the order of nature and of life. Othello says,
<i>Nature could not invest herself in such shadowing passion
without</i> instruction. <i>It is not words that shake me thus.</i>
This passion, which spreads its clouds over me, is the effect of
some agency more than the operation of words; it is one of those
notices which men have of unseen calamities.</p>
<p>IV.i.76 (471,4) Confine yourself but in a patient list] For
attention; act of listening.</p>
<p>IV.i.82 (471,5) encave yourself] Hide yourself in a private
place.</p>
<p>IV.i.89 (471,6) Or I shall say, you are all in all in
spleen,/And nothing of a man] I read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Or shall I say, you're all in all a spleen</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I think our author uses this expression elsewhere.</p>
<p>IV.i.121 (472,8) Do you triumph, Roman? do you triumph?] Othello
calls him <i>Roman</i> ironically. <i>Triumph</i>, which was a
Roman ceremony, brought Roman into his thoughts. <i>What</i> (says
he) <i>you are now</i> triumphing <i>as great as a Roman</i>?</p>
<p>IV.i.123 (472,9) a customer!] A common woman, one that invites
custom.</p>
<p>IV.i.130 (473,1) Have you scar'd me? Have you made my reckoning?
have you settled the term of my life? The old quarto reads,
<i>stored</i> me. Have you disposed of me? have you laid me up?</p>
<p>IV.i.150 (473,2) 'Tis such another fitchew! marry, a perfum'd
one] Shakespeare has in another place mentioned the lust of this
animal. He tells Iago, that she is as lewd as the <i>polecat</i>,
but of better scent, the polecat being a very stinking animal.</p>
<p>IV.i.244 (476,4) atone them] Make them <i>one</i>; reconcile
them.</p>
<p>IV.i.256 (477,5)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>If that the earth could teem with woman's tears,</p>
<p>Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>If womens tears could impregnate the earth. By the doctrine of
equivocal generation, new animals were supposed producible by new
combinations of matter. See Bacon.</p>
<p>IV.i.277 (478,7)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i6">whose solid virtue</p>
<p>The shot of accident, nor dart of chance,</p>
<p>Could neither graze nor pierce]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>[T: of change] To <i>graze</i> is not merely to touch
superficially, but to strike not directly, not so as to bury the
body of the thing striking in the matter struck.</p>
<p>Theobald trifles, as is usual. <i>Accident</i> and <i>chance</i>
may admit a subtle distinction; <i>accident</i> may be considered
as the <i>act</i>, and <i>chance</i> as the <i>power</i> or
<i>agency</i> of fortune; as, <i>It was</i> by chance <i>that
this</i> accident <i>befel me</i>. At least, if we suppose all
corrupt that is inaccurate, there will be no end of emendation.</p>
<p>IV.ii.57 (482,1) garner'd up my heart] That is, <i>treasured</i>
up; the <i>garner</i> and the <i>fountain</i> are improperly
conjoined.</p>
<p>IV.ii.62 (482,2)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Turn thy complexion there!</p>
<p>Patience, thou young and rose-lipp'd cherubim;</p>
<p>Ay, there, look grim as hell]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>At such an object do thou, <i>patience</i>, thyself <i>change
colour</i>; at this do thou, even thou, <i>rosy cherub</i> as thou
art, <i>look grim as hell</i>. The old editions and the new have
it,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>I here look grim as hell.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>I</i> was written for <i>ay</i>, and not since corrected.</p>
<p>IV.ii.109 (484,4) The small'st opinion on my great'st abuse] The
old quarto reads [for "least misuse"],</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>The small'st opinion on my</i> great'st abuse.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Which I think is better.</p>
<p>IV.ii.140 (486,6) Some base notorious knave] For <i>gross</i>,
not in its proper meaning for <i>known</i>.</p>
<p>IV.ii.144 (486,7) Speak within door] Do not clamour so as to be
heard beyond the house.</p>
<p>IV.ii.146 (486,8) the seamy side without] That is, <i>inside
out</i>.</p>
<p>IV.iii.27 (490,2) and he, she lov'd, prov'd mad,/And did forsake
her] I believe that <i>mad</i> only signifies <i>wild, frantick,
uncertain</i>.</p>
<p>IV.iii.31 (490,3) I have much to do,/But to go hang my head] I
<i>have much</i> ado to do any thing <i>but hang my head</i>. We
might read,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Not <i>to go hang my head</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is perhaps the only insertion made in the latter editions
which has improved the play. The rest seem to have been added for
the sake of amplification, or of ornament. When the imagination had
subsided, and the mind was no longer agitated by the horror of the
action, it became at leisure to look round for specious additians.
This addition is natural. Desdemona can at first hardly forbear to
sing the song; she endeavours to change her train of thoughts, but
her imagination at last prevails, and she sings it.</p>
<p>IV.iii.41 (491,4)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Des.</i> "The poor soul sat singing by a sycamore-tree,</p>
<p>"Sing all a green willow]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This song, in two parts, is printed in a late collection of old
ballads; the lines preserved here differ somewhat from the copy
discovered by the ingenious collector.</p>
<p>IV.iii.55 (491,5)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Des.</i> "I call'd my love false love; but what said</p>
<p>"he then?</p>
<p>"Sing willow, &amp;c.]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This couplet is not in the ballad, which is the complaint, not
of a woman forsaken, but of a man rejected. These lines were
probably added when it was accommodated to a woman.</p>
<p>IV.iii.94 (493,6) our former having] Our former allowance of
experience.</p>
<p>IV.iii.107 (493,7) heaven me such usage send] &mdash;<i>heaven
me such</i> uses <i>send</i>,] Such is the reading of the folio,
and of the subsequent editions; but the old quarto has,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;<i>such</i> usage <i>send</i>.&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>Usage</i> is an old word for <i>custom</i>, and, I think,
better than <i>uses</i>.</p>
<p>V.i.11 (494,1) I have rubb'd this young quat <i>almost to the
sense</i>] In some editions,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>I've rubb'd this young</i> gnat <i>almost to the
sense,</i></p>
<p><i>And he grows angry</i>.]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is a passage much controverted among the editors. Sir T.
Hanner reads <i>quab</i>, a <i>gudgeon</i>; not that a gudgeon can
be <i>rubbed</i> to much <i>sense</i>, but that a man grossly
deceived is often called a <i>gudgeon</i>. Mr. Upton reads
<i>quail</i>, which he proves, by much learning, to be a very
choleric bird. Dr. Warburton retains <i>gnat</i>, which is found in
the early quarto. Theobald would introduce <i>knot</i>, a small
bird of that name. I have followed the text of the folio, and third
and fourth quartos.</p>
<p>A <i>quat</i> in the midland counties is a <i>pimple</i>, which
by rubbing is made to smart, or is <i>rubbed to sense</i>. Roderigo
is called a <i>quat</i> by the same mode of speech, as a low fellow
is now termed in lay language a <i>scab. To rub to the sense</i>,
is <i>to rub to the quick</i>.</p>
<p>V.i.37 (496,2) No passage?] No passengers? No body going by?</p>
<p>V.i.42 (499,4) a heary night] A <i>thick cloudy</i> night, in
which an ambush may be commodiously laid.</p>
<p>V.ii.1 (499,4) It is the cause, it is the cause, my
soul;&mdash;/Let me not name it] The abruptness of this soliloquy
makes it obscure. The meaning, I think, is this: "I am here (says
Othello in his mind) overwhelmed with horror. What is the reason of
this perturbation? Is it want of resolution to do justice? Is it
the dread of shedding blood? No; it is not the action that shocks
me, but <i>it is the cause, it is the cause, my soul; let me not
name it to you, ye chaste stars; it is the cause</i>."</p>
<p>V.ii.20 (500,7)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i6">I must weep,</p>
<p>But they are cruel tears: this sorrel's heavenly;</p>
<p>It strikes, where it doth love.&mdash;She wakes&mdash;]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This tenderness, with which I lament the punishment which
justice compels me to inflict, is a holy passion.</p>
<p>I wish these two lines could be honestly ejected. It is the fate
of Shakespeare to counteract his own pathos.</p>
<p>V.ii.65 (502,8) A murder, which I thought a sacrifice] This line
is difficult. <i>Thou hast hardened my heart, and makest me</i>
kill thee with the rage of a <i>murderer</i>, when <i>I thought to
have sacrificed</i> thee to justice with the calmness of a priest
striking a victim.</p>
<p>It must not be omitted, that one of the elder quartos reads,
<i>thou dost stone</i> thy <i>heart</i>; which I suspect to be
genuine. The meaning then will be, <i>thou forcest me</i> to
dismiss thee from the world in the state of the <i>murdered</i>
without preparation for death, <i>when I intended</i> that thy
punishment should have been a <i>sacrifice</i> atoning for thy
crime.</p>
<p>I am glad that I have ended my revisal of this dreadful scene.
It is not to be endured.</p>
<p>V.ii.134 (505,3) false as water] As water that will support no
weight, nor keep any impression.</p>
<p>V.ii.151 (506,4) villainy has made mocks with love]
<i>Villainy</i> has taken advantage to <i>play upon</i> the
weakness of a violent passion.</p>
<p>V.ii.162 (506,5) Thou hast not half that power to do me harm,
/As I have to be hurt] [Hamner: to bear hurt] The Oxford Editor saw
well the meaning of his author, but weakened his expression. She
means to say, <i>I have in this cause power to endure more than
thou hast power to inflict</i>.</p>
<p>V.ii.183 (507, 6) charm your tongue] I know not whether I have
read, or whether my own thoughts hare suggested, an alteration of
this passage. It seems to me not improbable, that Shakespeare wrote
<i>clam</i> your tongue; to <i>clam</i> a bell, is to cover the
clapper with felt, which drowns the blow, and hinders the
sound.</p>
<p>V.ii.211 (509,7) she with Cassio had the act of shame/A thousand
times committed] This is another passage which seems to suppose a
longer space comprised in the action of this play than the scenes
include.</p>
<p>V.ii.253 (512,2) It was a sword of Spain, the ice-brook's
temper] [In the first edition it is, <i>Isebroke's temper</i>.
Thence corrupted to <i>Ice-brook's</i>.&mdash;<i>Ebro's temper</i>;
the waters of that river of Spain are particularly famous for
tempering of steel. POPE.] I believe the old reading changed to
<i>ice-brook</i> is right. Steel is hardened by being put red hot
into very cold water.</p>
<p>V.ii.286 (513,3)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>I look down towards his feet; but that's a fable.</p>
<p>If that thou be'st a devil, I cannot kill thee]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>To see if, according to the common opinion, his feet be
cloven.</p>
<p>V.ii.292 (513,4) Fall'n in the practice of a cursed slave] In
the <i>snare</i>, by the <i>stratagem</i>.</p>
<p>V.ii.317 (514,5) in the interim] The first copy has, <i>in
the</i> nick. It was, I suppose, thought upon revisal, that
<i>nick</i> was too familiar.</p>
<p>V.ii.342 (515,6) Speak of me as I am] The early copies read,
<i>Speak of them as they are</i>. The present reading has more
force. (rev. 1778, X, 622, 6)</p>
<p>(520,2) General Observation. The beauties of this play impress
themselves so strongly upon the attention of the reader, that they
can draw no aid from critical illustration. The fiery openness of
Othello, magnanimous, artless, and credulous, boundless in his
confidence, ardent in his affection, inflexible in his resolution,
and obdurate in his revenge; the cool malignity of Iago, silent in
his resentment, subtle in his designs, and studious at once of his
interest and his vengeance; the soft simplicity of Desdemona,
confident of merit, and conscious of innocence, her artless
perseverance in her suit, and her slowness to suspect that she can
be suspected, are such proofs of Shakespeare's skill in human
nature, as, I suppose, it is vain to seek in any modern writer. The
gradual progress which Iago makes in the Moor's conviction, and the
circumstances which he employs to inflame him, are so artfully
natural, that, though it will perhaps not be said of him as he says
of himself, that he is <i>a man not easily jealous</i>, yet we
cannot but pity him, when at last we find him <i>perplexed in the
extreme</i>.</p>
<p>There is always danger, lest wickedness, conjoined with
abilities, should steal upon esteem, though it misses of
approbation; but the character of Iago is so conducted, that he is
from the first scene to the last hated and despised.</p>
<p>Even the inferior characters of this play would be very
conspicuous in any other piece, not only for their justness, but
their strength. Cassio is brave, benevolent, and honest, ruined
only by his want of stubbornness to resist an insidious invitation.
Roderigo's suspicious credulity, and impatient submission to the
cheats which he sees practised upon him, and which by persuasion he
suffers to be repeated, exhibit a strong picture of a weak mind
betrayed by unlawful desires to a false friend; and the virtue of
Aemilia is such as we often find, worn loosely, but not cast off,
easy to commit small crimes, but quickened and alarmed at atrocious
villainies.</p>
<p>The scenes from the beginning to the end are busy, varied by
happy interchanges, and regularly promoting the progression of the
story; and the narrative in the end, though it tells but what is
known already, yet is necessary to produce the death of
Othello.</p>
<p>Had the scene opened in Cyprus, and the preceding incidents been
occasionally related, there had been little wanting to a drama of
the most exact and scrupulous regularity.</p>
<p>(LI 2) Appendix. Some apology perhaps is necessary for the
inconvenience of an Appendix, which, however, we can justify by the
strongest of all pleas, the plea of necessity. The Notes which it
contains, whether communicated by correspondents, or collected from
published volumes, were not within our reach when the plays were
printed, to which they relate. Of that which chance has supplied,
we could have no previous knowledge; and he that waited till the
river should run dry, did not act with less reason than the Editor
would do, who should suspend his publication for possibilities of
intelligence, or promises of improvement. Had we foreseen the
<i>Oxford</i> edition, the assistance we expected from it might
have persuaded us to pause; but our volumes were completely
finished before its publication. [There are no notes by Johnson in
this Appendix; several are by Steevens.]</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
